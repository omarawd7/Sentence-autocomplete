Newcastle United: Sven Botman out for up to nine months with ACL injuryLast updated on 4 hours ago4 hours ago.From the section NewcastleSven Botman has played 16 times for Newcastle since returning from a previous knee injury in DecemberNewcastle United defender Sven Botman is expected to be out for "six to nine months" after a scan revealed he needs surgery on a knee injury.The Dutchman injured his anterior cruciate ligament in Saturday's FA Cup defeat at Manchester City and had to be substituted late on.The 24-year-old centre-back will have surgery next week."Everyone at Newcastle United wishes Sven a full and speedy recovery," the club said.Botman initially sustained a knee injury in September and missed 17 games - including the final five of the Magpies' Champions League group games - before returning in December.Newcastle said it was decided not to send Botman for surgery at that stage and he regained full fitness through a rehabilitation programme.Botman has started the majority of Newcastle's matches since his return, but had to be brought off in the 83rd minute of the 2-0 loss to Manchester City in their quarter-final tie at the weekend.Newcastle added: "Following further assessment, a scan has confirmed that he sustained an injury to his ACL during Saturday's match and he is expected to return to action within six-to-nine months."It is the latest in a series of long-term injury blows for Magpies manager Eddie Howe this season.England goalkeeper Nick Pope has been out since December with a shoulder injury, while Brazil midfielder Joelinton and Three Lions striker Callum Wilson have also been missing for extended periods.Botman, who has previously been called up by the Netherlands but not yet made his international debut, will miss out on the chance of playing in the Euro 2024 finals.Latest Newcastle United news, analysis and fan viewsGet Magpies news notificationsListen to the latest Newcastle United PodcastOur coverage of Newcastle United is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a momentEverything Newcastle - go straight to all the best contentTop storiesToney and Tonali gambling bans a disgrace - MersonFormer Arsenal winger Paul Merson says football is "ravaged" with gambling and the bans given to Ivan Toney and Sandro Tonali are a "disgrace".Wales braced for crunch Finland Euro play-offWales will be one win away from Euro 2024 if they beat Finland in their home play-off semi-final on Thursday.Farrell still 'happy' with England decisionSaracens fly-half Owen Farrell remains "happy" with his decision to step away from England and is focusing on enjoying his rugby again.Elsewhere on the BBCGo inside a council on the verge of bankruptcyPanorama follows councillors and officials in Havering as they make decisions amidst a £50 million deficitThe moment a fireball was caught on camera...But what was it, and where did it end up?The year that shaped a generationUntold stories from the men and women on the frontlines during the 1984 miners' strikeFrom the Big Bang to BrexitLandmark mockumentary-maker Philomena Cunk traces the history of Britain and the worldAlso in SportBest tries of the 2024 Six Nations Lineker and Shearer get wound up by wingers Luxembourg's 'extraordinary' rise to brink of history Toney and Tonali gambling bans a disgrace - Merson Why Bell put England before a £30,000 WPL deal 'I was a world champion when diagnosed with ADHD' 'I nearly quit - but now I'm ready for Olympic dogfight' Are Scotland on the slide after three Six Nations defeats?

Euro 2024 play-offs: 'Relaxed' Wales braced for crunch Finland semi-finalBy Dafydd PritchardBBC Sport WalesLast updated on 4 hours ago4 hours ago.From the section Footballcomments359Euro 2024 play-offs: Wales v Finland - The red wall expectsEuro 2024 qualifying play-off semi-final: Wales v FinlandVenue: Cardiff City Stadium Date: Thursday, 21 March Kick-off: 19:45 GMTCoverage: Live on S4C, BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru, BBC Sounds, BBC Sport website and app, plus live textHighlights: Match of the Day Wales, BBC One Wales from 22:40 and later on demandWales will be one win away from Euro 2024 if they beat Finland in their home play-off semi-final on Thursday.Victory will set up a one-leg play-off final at Cardiff City Stadium against Poland or Estonia on Tuesday.Having failed to qualify for a major tournament between 1958 and 2016, Wales are aiming to reach their fourth out of five - and a third successive Euros."There's everything to play for but we're fully prepared for it," said Wales manager Robert Page."It's quite a relaxed environment and that's not because we're blase about it or taking things for granted. "We're in good form at this moment in time, most of the squad are playing football for their clubs, training has been excellent. "We have gone through similar experiences with the pressure of the play-off situations against Austria and Ukraine [to qualify for the 2022 World Cup], and the difficulty surrounding that. "We are all quite relaxed but not underestimating the challenge."How Davies is Wales and Tottenham's reluctant starWatch: Feast of Football Euro 2024 play-off specialAmpadu eyes date with destiny and historyWales are still in the midst of the most successful period in their history, albeit perhaps at the tail end of their absolute peak following the departures of some notable players.This has been their first qualifying campaign since the retirement of Gareth Bale - arguably the greatest player in Wales' history - and other key figures such as Joe Allen.Such a period of adjustment has brought with it some turbulence, including a humiliating home defeat against Armenia last June and other poor results which put Page under pressure at times.His players rallied superbly to beat World Cup semi-finalists Croatia last October but, ultimately, Wales still missed out on automatic qualification after finishing behind Turkey and Croatia in their group.'Putting the Welsh shirt on brings out our best' - Ben DaviesLuckily for Page and his players, however, their performance in the Nations League over recent years secured them the back-up option of a play-off place."We have lost one of the world's best players with Gareth," said Page."There's been enough in the squad to put us in a position where we are two wins away from qualifying for the fourth time [out of five major tournaments]. "Of course he's going to be missed on and off the pitch but it gives others an opportunity, like Harry Wilson, probably a bit-part player when Gareth was at his peak. "Now 'H' has made a stake for a starting position again and, with what he's doing at club level, has earnt that right. Others have taken that opportunity with both hands and are relishing that challenge."Finland also finished third in their group, with Denmark and Slovenia taking the automatic qualification spots.The Finns are aiming to qualify for only their second major tournament, having made it to the group stage of Euro 2020.Team newsBen Davies (right) will captain Wales again if Aaron Ramsey (left) is not fit enough to startWales captain Aaron Ramsey is expected to be on the bench, having only made a brief substitute appearance for Cardiff City last Saturday following a calf strain.Tottenham Hotspur defender Ben Davies is set to wear the armband again, having led Wales in October and November when Ramsey was ruled out with a knee injury.Ipswich Town winger Wes Burns, Swansea City centre-back Ben Cabango and Wycombe Wanderers central defender Joe Low have withdrawn from Wales' squad because of injury.Niall Huggins, Joe Morrell and Tom Bradshaw were already missing through injury, while Luton Town captain Tom Lockyer is not included as he continues his recovery from the cardiac arrest he suffered during a Premier League match in December.Finland are without midfielder Robert Taylor, while Middlesbrough striker Marcus Forss is a doubt.Match factsThis will be Wales' 16th meeting with Finland in all competitions - excluding the home nations and Republic of Ireland, they've only ever faced the Czech Republic (18), Belgium (17) and Germany (17) more often.Wales are unbeaten in their past four meetings with Finland in all competitions, most recently a 0-0 draw in a friendly in September 2021.Finland lost their last away game against Wales 3-1 in November 2020. Prior to this, they had been unbeaten each of their last five such visits (two wins, three draws).Wales have won their past two competitive meetings with Finland, both in the Nations League in 2020. They've never won three in a row against them before.Wales have never won a European Championship play-off match, drawing and losing against Hungary in 1962-1963, Yugoslavia in 1976 and Russia in 2003. However, they did qualify for the 2022 World Cup via the play-offs.This is Finland's first appearance in the play-off rounds for either the World Cup or European Championship. They won six games in the group stages, their joint-most in a single Euro or World Cup qualifying campaign.Daniel James has been involved in five goals in his past five home appearances for Wales (one goal, four assists), scoring or assisting every 55 minutes across those appearances.Teemu Pukki - who is Finland's all-time leading scorer (39) and has won the second-most caps (118) behind Jari Litmanen (137) - has been involved in 17 goals in his last 18 European Championship qualifying appearances (12 goals, five assists).commentsView Comments360CommentsJoin the conversation

From Paris to the world - football's hottest talent factoryBy Sam Sheringham and John BennettBBC World Service SportLast updated on 6 February 20246 February 2024.From the section European FootballGeorges Kevin Nkoudou, Warren Zaire-Emery, Kylian Mbappe and Sofiane Boufal are all products of the most prolific football talent hotbed in the worldSign up for notifications to the latest Insight features via the BBC Sport app and find the most recent in the series here.Ibrahima Traore smiles as he parks his black Range Rover outside the apartment block where his footballing story began. He is back in Pantin, just outside the north-east corner of the peripherique - the ring road that separates central Paris from its suburbs. Amid the din of sirens and the aroma of fast food, Traore buzzes in and takes the lift to the fifth floor. The doors open and his brother is waiting to welcome him back to their childhood home.Inside, there are photos of the pair's Guinean father and Lebanese mother, as well as shots of grandparents and younger generations of the family. Dominating the view through the floor-to-ceiling windows, across a dual carriageway and tramline, is a vast sports complex, with two 4G football pitches."That's our Camp Nou, our Anfield," Traore says. "We used to jump over the fence at seven in the morning to practise our free-kicks. Before school and after school, it was football. Only football."LISTEN: Paris - football's greatest talent factoryFor many of the kids growing up here, constant practice can lead to the ultimate reward - a career in the professional game.Traore, now 35, played more than 250 games for four different clubs in Germany's Bundesliga and captained Guinea at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. Traore moved from Paris to Hertha Berlin as an 18-year-old and, despite offers from the Premier League, remained in the Bundesliga for the rest of his professional careerHis inspiration growing up came from the success around him, rather than the television screen."I remember just across the street, we had the player who used to play for Manchester United: Gabriel Obertan," says Traore. "It's the dream from everyone and then even more when you have someone who comes from the same suburb who makes it."When you hear that it's possible that, being from this area, you can play for a team like Manchester United, that is something that you want to follow, you want to pursue."As the clock strikes 4pm, children and coaches flood on to the pitches below. Aston Villa's Moussa Diaby, former Arsenal winger Nicolas Pepe and France and Monaco defender Youssouf Fofana all started out at the same facility, which is shared by local clubs Esperance Paris 19eme and Solitaire Paris Est.On the biggest stage of them all, Paris' finest are everywhere. Thirty players at the 2022 men's World Cup in Qatar were born in the vicinity of France's capital. Compare that to two other hotbeds of youth football: Sao Paulo provided 12 World Cup players and Greater London eight.There were 11 Parisians in the France squad that lost to Argentina in the final, with the other 19 spread across eight national teams: Morocco, Tunisia, Senegal, Ghana, Cameroon, Portugal, Germany and Qatar.And then you have the icons of the recent past. World Cup winners Thierry Henry, N'Golo Kante and Paul Pogba all grew up in the banlieues(suburbs) of the French capital, as did Kante's former Leicester team-mate Riyad Mahrez.  How has Paris become a city that churns out more football talent than anywhere else?Traore, third from left and partially obscured, poses with friends in a childhood picture on the neighbourhood pitch where he honed his skillsPost-war immigration from football-loving former French colonies in north and west Africa is the obvious reason why Ile-de-France - as suburban Paris is known - is such a remarkable football factory. Traore was born in Paris before moving to Guinea, settling back in the French capital from the age of four with his mother and siblings.  "You have a lot of people from North Africa round here; we used to say they are the real street footballers," he adds. "Then you have a lot of Senegalese, Guinean, Malian people round here. In the summer, we used to do an Africa Cup. All the Guinean players would be in one team. All the Malian players, they will be in one team. Ivory Coast… whatever you want. It's crazy, because everyone is defending his country, and then it's just insane."It was during one of these informal tournaments that a local scout spotted Traore and set him on the path of a professional career.But that influx of talent and culture also emerged into an environment perfect for super-charging player development.A local government policy of building high-quality football facilities in every Paris banlieue, partly to keep kids off the streets and out of trouble, has been fundamental to making the sport cheap and accessible to all."You come down from your building and you have a football field, so the first thing you do is go play football," says Abdelaziz Kaddour, sports director of FC Montfermeil 93, a thriving club in Seine Saint-Denis, a suburban Paris region with one of the highest crime and unemployment rates in France. Abdelaziz and Montfermeil oversaw the development of Arsenal defender William Saliba after he transferred from nearby AS Bondy, the club where France superstar Kylian Mbappe played as a child."Young people round here play football practically all day long," says Abdelaziz. "And on top of that, most of the pitches are small. That means, they touch the ball a lot. They learn to dribble. And over time, it gives them a lot of quality, dribbling, speed, seeing things before others, tackling, intensity. "And what's more, they want to make a living from football. They have the spirit. When you ask them the question, they want to be professional footballers at all costs. "This is not an easy place to live. Many families are in difficulty. The children know it and give their all to succeed. It builds a mentality and that perhaps makes the difference, in addition to talent."A 12-year-old Mbappe is interviewed by television while training for AS Bondy in May 2011Sebastien Bassong, the former Tottenham, Newcastle and Cameroon defender, began his passage to football stardom at Deuil Enghein, a club located in Val d'Oise, directly to the north of Paris. He says football is "in the DNA" of those who grow up in the banlieues."There's a certain mindset that's very contagious," says Bassong. "I've got bigger brothers, so to make myself a name was difficult. But as soon as I started playing football, people started seeing me differently. I started to exist as soon as football came into my life. I started to puff my chest out a bit."Bassong's talents were such that at the age of 13, he followed the path taken by Henry and Nicolas Anelka to Clairefontaine, the world-famous residential academy that has long cherry-picked the best talent from the Ile-de-France area."We call it the Harvard of football," says Bassong. "Most of my football IQ came from Clairefontaine. You think football, you drink football, you smell football, you sleep with your ball and, above all, you learn discipline. They develop champions."Bassong, pictured as a child, represented France's Under-21 side before playing for Cameroon at senior levelThose not fortunate enough to be spotted by the scouts of Clairefontaine improve their skills in one of the biggest and most competitive amateur leagues in world football. The Ligue de Paris Ile-de-France has more than 1,000 clubs and 270,000 players. It's such an important organisation that it has an office in the picture-perfect Place Valois, a well-struck free-kick away from the Louvre museum, right in the heart of Paris."Some of the great French players, or players who play in the major European leagues, say that what served them best was training in the Ile-de-France, that the level was very, very good," says the league's president Jamel Sandjak, a former defender of Algerian descent who played in the league before moving into football administration."Most of the France national youth teams are full of our players. So our regional teams are playing at national level. Scouts from all over the world come to Ile-de-France to look at players in our leagues."The proliferation of foreign scouts explains the vast numbers of Parisian players who end up in the Premier League, with Liverpool's Ibrahima Konate and Chelsea's Axel Disasi among the latest batch. Konate even returned to his old Paris banlieue to unveil his Liverpool shirt,external-link while a delirious crowd lit red flares and chanted his name.Clairefontaine, as well as tutoring Greater Paris' finest young talent, is the long-standing home of the France national teamEnglish teams have benefited from the fact that Paris St-Germain, the one truly elite club in the Paris region, has long favoured spending on overseas galacticos over developing homegrown talent. This policy came back to bite them in their one and only Champions League final in 2020, when they lost 1-0 to Bayern Munich, the winner scored by Kingsley Coman, a player PSG had released on a free transfer to Juventus six years earlier.Yves Gergaud, a former PSG youth coach who scouted Coman at the age of nine, says the then-18-year-old winger's departure from the Qatari-owned club was prompted by the £33.5m arrival of Brazilian Lucas Moura to play in his position. "It's all about business," says Gergaud. "For 15 or 20 years now, they have wanted to win the Champions League, and they are trying to achieve that by attracting very great players, like Messi, like Neymar, like Thiago Silva."But unfortunately, they are still perhaps missing a little bit of soul. "You have the academy in one corner, and the pro team in another corner, directors and managers changing all the time, so it's very difficult to really develop players. But it's true that you could field three or four teams of players from the Paris region in the Champions League."For their part, PSG owner Nasser Al-Khelaifi insists the era of "flashy bling-bling" is overexternal-link and the club point to the emergence of 17-year-old midfielder Warren Zaire-Emery - now a starter for France as well as his club - as evidence that the academy and first team are more closely attuned. Gergaud is not convinced.Kylian Mbappe, left, was born and raised in Paris, like Warren Zaire-Emery (right) but only arrived at the Parc des Princes via a £166m transfer from Monaco"I was at Paris St-Germain from 2002 to 2007 and people were already saying that at the time," he adds. "There is good work done in the academy. The scouts do a good job - they manage to detect very good young people but then it's difficult to get them to the first team because they don't have a reserve team and they find themselves being restricted to the under-19 championship."So there are players who can be ready like Warren Zaire-Emery at 16 or 17 years old, but there are others who should be able to keep developing at PSG and reach the first team."The concentration of young talent in one city and its suburbs has created something of a circus around Paris' grassroots football. Montfermeil sporting director Abdelaziz says there are often more scouts and agents than family members on the sidelines."When I started, I was scouting a lot in the Paris area but now it's starting to be impossible," says Jennifer Mendelewitsch, an agent from Supernova Management, based in the Bois de Boulogne in western Paris."There are too many agents, too many people are trying to find the kid, the boy, who's going to make it. Right now, it's the jungle to get a player in the Paris area. "You speak to a family and they already have agents and the kid is only 12. It's way too early. Let them be a kid. If they're going to make it, they're going to make it." Even as she delivers the words, Mendelewitsch knows she's fighting a lost cause. With Mbappe and Zaire-Emery at the head of an army of talent, the battle for the brightest stars in the city of lights is as fierce as any on the pitch.Previously in the Insight seriesNew wave - how one surf club is changing GhanaGuardiola, Mourinho and the game the changed everything Hot wheels - how wheelchair tennis became a Grand Slam draw'Frozen eyes, frozen toes' - the brutal race that may never returnStep inside the pain cave, where rules are remadeElsewhere on the BBCGo inside a council on the verge of bankruptcyPanorama follows councillors and officials in Havering as they make decisions amidst a £50 million deficitThe moment a fireball was caught on camera...But what was it, and where did it end up?The year that shaped a generationUntold stories from the men and women on the frontlines during the 1984 miners' strikeFrom the Big Bang to BrexitLandmark mockumentary-maker Philomena Cunk traces the history of Britain and the worldAlso in SportBest tries of the 2024 Six Nations Lineker and Shearer get wound up by wingers Luxembourg's 'extraordinary' rise to brink of history Toney and Tonali gambling bans a disgrace - Merson Why Bell put England before a £30,000 WPL deal 'I was a world champion when diagnosed with ADHD' 'I nearly quit - but now I'm ready for Olympic dogfight' Are Scotland on the slide after three Six Nations defeats?

Football Governance Bill: Legislation for independent football regulator being introducedLast updated on 19 March 202419 March 2024.From the section Footballcomments2025Football fans protested outside stadiums following the announcement of the European Super League in April 2021The UK government will continue plans for an independent football regulator when the Football Governance Bill is introduced in Parliament on Tuesday.The legislation would grant powers to a body, independent of government and football authorities, to oversee clubs in England's top five men's tiers.The government announced plans to appoint a regulator in February 2023, following a fan-led review in 2022.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said it is "a historic moment for football fans".West Ham owner Sullivan opposes independent football regulator"It will make sure their voices are front and centre," he added. "Football has long been one of our greatest sources of national pride."But for too long some clubs have been abused by unscrupulous owners who get away with financial mismanagement, which at worst can lead to complete collapse - as we saw in the upsetting cases of Bury and Macclesfield Town."After the Bill is introduced, it must go through parliamentary process before it is made law.The legislation follows a fan-led review, which said a regulator was necessary for the long-term financial stability of the men's professional game after issues including financial mismanagement and plans for a breakaway European Super League.Everton and Nottingham Forest have both been deducted points this season for breaching Premier League profit and sustainability rules (PSR).The regulator will have powers revolving around three core objectives: improving financial sustainability of clubs, ensuring financial resilience across the leagues and safeguarding English football's heritage.Rick Parry, chair of the English Football League (EFL), said: "If delivered on the right terms, this landmark legislation can help fix the game's broken financial model by offering the independent input ultimately needed to help ensure that all clubs can survive and thrive in a fair and competitive environment."A Premier League statement read: "With our clubs, we have advocated for a proportionate regime that enables us to build on our position as the most widely watched league in the world."Mindful that the future growth of the Premier League is not guaranteed, we remain concerned about any unintended consequences of legislation that could weaken the competitiveness and appeal of English football."The Premier League remains fully committed to delivering its world-leading funding to the wider game, through £1.6bn distributed to all levels of football across the current three-year term."What powers will regulator have?New club owners and directors will face stronger tests to help prevent the possibility of them putting clubs out of business, as was the case with Bury and Macclesfield, while a licensing system covering clubs from the National League up to the Premier League has been proposed.As part of their licence, clubs will be required to consult their fans on key off-field decisions, such as club heritage and the club's strategic direction."Football is nothing without its fans," said Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer. "We are determined to put them back at the heart of the game and ensure clubs as vital community assets continue to thrive."The new regulator will set the game on a sustainable footing, strengthening clubs and the entire football pyramid for generations."Premier League: Fallout from failure to agree funding deal with EFL could last yearsThe bill also includes new backstop powers around financial distributions between the Premier League and the EFL, so that if the two parties continue to fail to agree on a 'new deal', the regulator can ensure a settlement is reached.The government has long warned the football authorities that an independent football regulator (IFR) would have such powers to intervene.Former sports minister Tracey Crouch, who chaired the fan-led review, said: "Football fans can begin to breathe a sigh of relief in the knowledge that the next steps towards protecting the long-term sustainability of the pyramid have now been taken."Kevin Miles, chief executive of the Football Supporters' Association, added: "The FSA warmly welcomes the tabling of the Football Governance Bill arising from the 2021 fan-led review, and particularly its central proposal to introduce statutory independent regulation of the game."The regulator must be given the power to impose a financial settlement in the interests of the sustainability of the game as a whole. It is far too important to be left to the squabbling between the vested interests of the richest club owners."However, campaign group Fair Game said "at first glance" it looks like the bill has "missed the target" and that they have "failed to get assurances that the regulator will have the power to intervene".West Ham owner David Sullivan told Sky Sports: "The Premier League is the best league in the world so why change a winning formula?"I hope the government don't wreck something that works. If over the coming seasons the Premier League ceases to be the best league in the world, it will be down to an interfering government."He added: "Between the 20 clubs there is almost £2bn of debt, so there isn't really 'available cash' to give away."TimelineAugust 2019: Bury are expelled from League One following the collapse of a takeover bid.December 2019: Conservatives promise a fan-led review in its 2019 general election manifesto in response to Bury's demise.2020-21 season: Covid-19 pandemic causes matches to be held behind closed doors, affecting revenue.April 2021: A proposed European Super League, involving six Premier League clubs, collapses within days amid widespread condemnation from other clubs and players as well as governing bodies, politicians and fans.October 2021: Amnesty International urges changes to the Premier League owners' and directors' test "to address human rights issues" following the Saudi Arabian-backed takeover of Newcastle United.November 2021: An independent regulator is among 10 recommendations made by a fan-led review, chaired by former Sports Minister Tracey Crouch, on how to improve football governance.March 2022: Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich is sanctioned by the UK government as part of its response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with Abramovich selling the club to American businessman Todd Boehly in May.November 2022: Representatives of 29 clubs write to the government urging it to press on with plans for an independent football regulator.February 2023: The publication of the UK government's white paper proposing reforms in football was delayed to later in the month.February 2023: The plan for a new independent regulator in English football was confirmed by the government.November 2023: King Charles outlined the government's plan for the Football Governance Bill in the King's Speech.Listen to the latest Football Daily podcastOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a momentcommentsView Comments2025CommentsJoin the conversation

Premier League relegation battle: Who will stay up?Last updated on 18 March 202418 March 2024.From the section Premier LeagueNottingham Forest: BBC Sport's Simon Stone explains the impact of points deductionWho will be playing Championship football next season and who will be celebrating Premier League survival?Nottingham Forest's four-point deduction for breaching Premier League profit and sustainability rules (PSR) means they drop into the relegation zone, one point behind Luton Town.Only five points separate Forest and the three teams immediately above them - Luton, Everton and Brentford - with Burnley and Sheffield United five and eight points adrift of safety respectively.It's complicated...While Forest have received their punishment, any appeal could complicate matters for them.Everton, meanwhile, still face an anxious wait after being charged by the Premier League in January for alleged breaches in their accounts for 2022-23.If they are found to have breached financial rules, they also face a points deduction. A verdict is not expected until April and would be subject to appeal.Any appeals could take that process to 24 May, the week after the season concludes on 19 May, although the belief is any appeal would be sorted before the final day.In November, Everton were immediately docked 10 points for breaking PSR in the three-year period to 2021-22.However, that punishment was reduced to six points after an appeal.Everton points deduction appeal verdict: What happens next?Everton points deduction: BBC Sport’s Simon Stone says story not over yetCurrent tablePremier League table as of 18 MarchTeamPlayedPointsGDForm (past 5 games)14.

Photograph: Nick Potts/PAWalesWales view a future beyond Ramsey with new brigade filling the voidRob Page’s team is built around a core of young talents but beating Finland in a Euro 2024 playoff semi-final is their first big testBen FisherWed 20 Mar 2024 17.40 GMTLast modified on Wed 20 Mar 2024 19.29 GMTShareListening to Rob Page last week discuss resisting the temptation to call up Lewis Koumas, the 18‑year‑old who scored on his Liverpool debut last month, was to ram home the sense that this really is a new era for Wales. A few minutes later Matty Jones, the Wales Under-21 manager who played with Koumas’s father, Jason, jested about the line doing the rounds at their base in the Vale of Glamorgan. “I think it is an internal joke at the moment that I just see former teammates of mine and look if their sons are playing,” he said.Page believes Wales are in rude health; the best place they have been in his tenure because so many players – except, worryingly, his four goalkeepers – are regularly making a dent for their clubs. But perhaps the most telling indication of the shift was when he suggested they do not need Aaron Ramsey in quite the same way they once did.Football Daily | Will Wales grasp their chance to get the Red Wall buzzing again?Read moreIt was the 33-year-old’s double that propelled Wales to Euro 2020, the same night that flag given to Gareth Bale stole the headlines. “Times have changed,” Page said. “We’re not where we were two or three years ago.”At the same time, the Wales mana­ger recognises the need to have ­something tangible to show for it, in this case a spot at the Euro 2024 finals in Germany. When it comes to Ramsey, Wales would welcome the panache of a player who has long dealt in magic moments but they no longer pine for his feathery touch or look to him to make the difference. Ramsey is ­captain in this post-Bale Wales world, though the ­vice‑captain, Ben Davies, is expected to lead the side against Finland on Thursday, when the teams meet in Cardiff in a playoff semi-final.The long-term heir to the ­armband, however, is Ethan Ampadu, who is poised to win his 50th cap at the age of 23 years, six months and eight days, reaching that milestone quicker than Bale and faster than any other Welshman. Ampadu, who has ­captained Leeds this season, is mature beyond his years, an unassuming character who picks his words carefully. When it was put to him that his leadership skills were evident when “­ordering people about” in his early days, Ampadu intervened. “I don’t like the word ‘ordering’,” he said.Ampadu is at the crux of a Wales side aiming to reach a third successive European Championship finals tournament. As a 15-year-old, Ampadu, while studying for his GCSEs at St Luke’s school in Exeter, trained with Chris Coleman’s squad in the buildup to Euro 2016 – he had the last laugh over his English classmates when Wales made it to the last four – and was a bit-part player at the delayed Euro 2020. Ampadu started all of Wales’s games at the World Cup in Qatar and has played every minute of this qualifying campaign, from Split to Samsun.Others, such as Harry Wilson and Neco Williams, have emerged from the shadows. Koumas, a fixture on the bench for Liverpool in recent weeks, is part of the next generation who Wales plan to nurture into the senior squad.View image in fullscreenJoe Rodon is one of a strong Leeds contingent in the Wales squad. Photograph: Nick Potts/PAFor Leeds, Ampadu has shone at centre-back alongside Joe Rodon – the club boast the meanest defence in the Championship – but he is primed to start in midfield alongside ­Birmingham’s Jordan James, 19, who is poised to win his ninth cap.Ampadu, by comparison, is a ­veteran. “It feels like he has been around for ever,” Rodon says. “I know it sounds a bit mad but he’s going to be one for the future.”Dan James, also of Leeds, is poised to record his half-century on Thursday. Rodon, on 42 caps, is not too far behind. The defender, on loan at Leeds from Tottenham, is part of a Welsh quartet vying for promotion at Elland Road. The sight of Ampadu, Rodon, James and Connor Roberts, who joined on loan in January, starring for the Championship leaders led to parallels with the Leeds vintage in the late 1970s, when a superb picture of Alan Curtis, Brian Flynn, Carl ­Harris and Byron Stevenson, their arms wrapped around each other on international duty in Malta, appeared in Shoot magazine. Then there are Gary Speed and John Charles, Welsh greats with Leeds in their blood.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Football DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ramsey played the final 23 minutes of Cardiff’s derby defeat by Swansea last Sunday but that represented his third appearance since September, all as a second-half substitute.For the first time this ­millennium, a Wales team without Bale or ­Ramsey – both of whom were at the heart of Wales’s nervy playoff win against Ukraine to secure their World Cup place – could reach a major tournament. “We have lost one of the world’s best players with Gareth,” Page said. “But there has been enough in the squad to put us into a position where we are two wins away from qualifying.”The tigerish midfield axis of Ampadu and Jordan James will be key if Wales are to tee up another playoff final in Cardiff next Tuesday against Poland or Estonia. Welcome to life after Bale, Joe Allen and, ­increasingly, Ramsey. While Page acknowledges this evolving Wales remain a work in progress, now is the time for this class to make their mark.“We’ve lost superstars with Gaz and Joe,” Rodon says. “It was always going to be difficult for us in the ­transition period but there is a really good balance in the group. The ­players now who are coming up to 50 caps have that experience in tournaments. It is not new to us to be in situations like this.”Explore more on these topicsWalesEuro 2024 qualifyingLeeds UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedFootballLive scoresTablesFixturesResultsCompetitionsClubsNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PABrazilInterviewBrazil coach Dorival Júnior: ‘It’s going to be the most exciting day of my life’Thiago Rabelo in São PauloIn an exclusive interview, the 61-year-old talks about his pride at being named Brazil coach, winning back fans and facing EnglandWed 20 Mar 2024 10.01 GMTShareDorival Júnior was appointed Brazil coach in January after 22 years in management, taking in clubs such as Cruzeiro, Santos, São Paulo, Palmeiras and Flamengo. The 61-year-old’s first game in charge will be against England at Wembley on Saturday. Here he speaks exclusively to the Guardian about his hopes for the job, why the Seleção need to reconnect with the fans and the racist abuse suffered by Vinícius Júnior.Dorival, first of all, tell us what it feels like to be the Brazil coach. Well, it’s hard for me to describe it. I’m very confident going into this job. I am confident because I’ve worked very hard to get to a place like this. I am not going to lie and I am not going to hide this feeling. I’ve always had great loyalty to my clubs and my teammates but I’ve also tried to prepare myself so that one day I might get a chance with the national team.I am living this moment as if it were a mixture of all the teams I’ve worked with and who suddenly gave me the chance to be here. I feel it especially because I have always been a supporter. I started supporting Ferroviária de Araraquara from the time I was six or seven, and since I started playing I always wanted a job in professional football. I studied PE, still not knowing if I was going to make it as a professional footballer. Then I had a career as a player for over 18 years so I’ve practically lived in a dressing room since I was six or seven.Why is the national team so special for you and for all Brazilians? For me, it is because I’ve always felt like a supporter of the national team. I’d stop what I was doing to watch the call-ups, I’d stop to watch the interviews of former teammates today, people who have passed through here for whom I have enormous respect, right? I think that goes back to [Mário] Zagallo, [Carlos Alberto] Parreira, Dunga, [Émerson] Leão, Vanderlei [Luxemburgo], Tite ... I am forgetting many names here but all of them who were part of this, of being in charge of a national team. I think it’s the pinnacle of a coach’s career.View image in fullscreenDorival Júnior speaks to his Brazil squad during a training session in London ahead of the friendly match against England. Photograph: Victoria Jones/PAAt the moment, though, it feels as if the fans and our national team are far apart from each other. I would like that gap to get smaller, for us to be much closer, for the fans to come back. And for that to happen, we have to instigate it. That would be the federation, the coaching staff and the players who are here working together to bring our fans closer to us. We need them to get back to having that passion, that feeling of watching your team and being represented by the players on the pitch.Why do you think we are in this position? Sometimes it’s very easy to throw stones, to point fingers. Instead I’d like it to be the other way round, for us all to realise that it’s not a good time [for the Seleção] but that we can use the help of the people to start finding solutions. I want the people to make suggestions for how we can try to solve the problems so that we once again can create a team that gives the fans confidence but, above all, so that fans can see themselves in this team and to be proud to wear the shirt again. We need to switch the lights on, not off, as has happened in recent years.Brazil have lost three of the first six World Cup qualifiers. Is the disconnect between fans and the team also because of the results? I don’t think results alone would distance us from something we really like. I think it’s a series of factors that have happened over the years. Like it or not, football’s development means that our best players have all been out of Brazil for a long time. To give you an idea, there are now around 1,500 to 1,600 Brazilian players outside the country and this has been going on for more than 10 years.That way you lose the identity as well as a bit of that closeness. You realise that a few players are very distant. That is not their fault but regardless of the results for the national team they won’t be back in the country the following week. Maybe they don’t understand what’s going on in our country because when they leave they’ll immediately have to turn their attention to their clubs abroad. So I think that all of this has led to a great deal of mistrust on everyone’s part. We also have understand the situation and I’m sure that they’ve always tried to do their best. Maybe something got in the way that we need to bring back. I think it’s something we can reverse. We have the qualities to give to our supporters more confidence and I hope each of them will be represented by the players who are on the pitch.But I have a lot of faith in the development of our work. I know this start won’t be easy and we won’t find a magic wand. Everything has to happen in a natural way. But we’ve prepared a lot for this moment and I’m going to dedicate myself to ensure that the Seleção can win back all the credit it possibly can in the eyes of the fans.View image in fullscreenBrazil fans have had little to cheer about recently, picking up one point from their past four World Cup qualifiers. Photograph: Nelson Almeida/AFP/Getty ImagesYour first match is against England at Wembley. Are they, with players such as Harry Kane, Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden and Declan Rice, the strongest team in the world today? England are a team of the highest calibre and they are showing that every step of the way at the moment. It is a team that is still developing but it is doing so at a very accelerated pace. It is being done by someone, Mr Southgate, who has, I believe, more than 90 games in charge of the team.He already has a very clear understanding of the potential of his squad and he has got players who are playing in one of the most competitive leagues in the world. In addition these players are moving away from what was known as the traditional way of England teams to play for years and years. These days they have much more possession, a lot more transitions and breakthrough moves.Today it seems that the biggest discussion in Brazil is that the national team no longer have any stars. How do you see the current Seleção? Feared and respected or not? It’s much more respected outside our country than it is here, I can tell you that. People have no idea how much Brazilian football is talked about outside our country. And I didn’t realise that just by getting this job now. No, I’ve been doing it since 2012. Every year I visited one club or another. I had the chance to talk to players, managers and coaches abroad who always showed great respect and admiration for Brazilian football. This doesn’t happen back home. Unfortunately, that’s the way it is in our country. Say someone wins the world surfing championship. He or she will never be recognised as the best. They need to win a second championship. And once they’ve won the second, they need to win a third championship. And so it is in any kind of sport here.We still have great players. Maybe not at the level we’ve had at other times. But we still have good players. We have a player who stands out on the world stage. Neymar is still going strong and, God willing, he’ll recover from his injury. And he could be a difference-maker for all of us.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Football DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

How does that make you feel? Sadly it is happening all over the world. Ignorance still remains. The authorities must take more severe action. This situation with Vinícius, in particular, has already crossed the line. The Spanish people in general are a very friendly, respectful and above all peaceful people and they should not have their image tarnished by a handful of malicious people. It should be possible to track down the people [who do the racist chanting] if the police put their mind to it. It is just like in our country, where many, many people suffer every day. But they are silenced by the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of the authorities.Do you think this situation further distances the Seleção and the fans? Yes, it distances the fans who can no longer bear to see this kind of abuse from a minority of people. This is no longer acceptable in society. People have to be respected in every way and in every sense.View image in fullscreenA Brazil fan shows support for Vinícius Júnior before the start of a June 2023 friendly against Guinea in Barcelona. Photograph: Pau Barrena/AFP/Getty ImagesIf it happens to Vinícius again, like it did for the Seleção’s last game in Europe, can you make a stronger stance? We will need to analyse and balance all of the information in such moments but we need to be prepared to take drastic action if it happens again. Vinícius is still a boy. He is still finishing his education and he can’t be treated like this by this minority.You have the Copa América this summer, are you thinking of a more experienced team for that? Thiago Silva has said he wants to return to the national team. Is there hope for him? All the names are on our radar. It will depend on the form of the player, you can be sure of that. It doesn’t matter if it is a youngster who’s just starting out or a great player with a fantastic record in the national team like Thiago. To them I say: “Don’t lose hope and, if you still have any expectations, keep working hard.”View image in fullscreenThiago Silva’s last appearance in a Brazil shirt was during their 2022 World Cup quarter-final defeat by Croatia. Photograph: Jack Guez/AFP/Getty ImagesYou have a difficult enough job to select your first starting XI for the England game but I am going to ask you something even tougher: what would be your all-time Brazil team? That’s very difficult. Oh well ... I’m going to work on the teams that won the World Cup, with the exception of one or two names. My goalkeeper is Leão. I have doubts between him and [Cláudio] Taffarel, but as Taffarel is one of my committee, he’ll understand me. Cafu, Aldair, [Hilderaldo] Bellini and Roberto Carlos; Dunga, because of his history and everything he has represented for the Seleção, he really deserves to be there. Zico and Rivellino. In attack, Ronaldinho Gaúcho, Ronaldo and Romário. I left out Pelé because he’s not human, he’s hors concours.Finally, on Saturday you will step on to the Wembley pitch for your first game as Brazil coach. How will that be for you? It’s going to be the most exciting day of my life, you can be sure of that. Winning a championship at the Morumbi Stadium or at the Maracanã is priceless, but to make my debut for the Brazilian national team at Wembley is something unique. What more could I want from life? God has been more than perfect for me. He has a lot of special things in store for me. But I also hope that this day will be surpassed in July 2026, by winning the World Cup. You can write that down, you can keep it. The start won’t be easy. I won’t hide it from you. But the end will be good. You can be sure of that.Explore more on these topicsBrazilfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedFootballLive scoresTablesFixturesResultsCompetitionsClubsNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Composite: Getty, ShutterstockGuardian Sport NetworkEnglandWhat if the England team was picked using stats for the season?Using thousands of statistics for hundreds of players this season, WhoScored have calculated England’s best XIBen McAleerWed 20 Mar 2024 14.33 GMTLast modified on Wed 20 Mar 2024 18.13 GMTShareAs international teams gear up for their first action this year, WhoScored have picked a team and 23-man squad of their best rated English players this season, with a few surprises thrown in for good measure.Goalkeeper: Nick Pope, Newcastle Nick Pope has not played since the beginning of December, but he remains the best English goalkeeper this season. The 31-year-old’s ongoing absence has proved catastrophic for Eddie Howe’s side. Since his injury against Manchester United, the team’s defensive record has plummeted from one of the very best in the league, to one of the worst. Newcastle conceded three or more goals in just one of the 14 league matches Pope has started this season; in the 14 games without him, they have allowed that to happen eight times. Rating: 6.72Right-back: Trent Alexander-Arnold, LiverpoolPlenty of England supporters were hoping Trent Alexander-Arnold would be given an audition in midfield in this month’s friendlies, but injury to the Liverpool man has scuppered that plan at least until June. Nonetheless, the 25-year-old takes his place in this XI at right-back, with his rating of 7.18 tied with Kieran Trippier as the best for a full-back in the Premier League this season. Rating: 7.18Left-back: Kieran Trippier, Newcastle It’s been a topsy-turvy campaign for Kieran Trippier, who occupies the left-back spot in this XI. He has made 63 key passes, which is more than any other defender in the league and fifth for all players in the division. No player has set up more goals (10) than the experienced Newcastle full-back. Rating: 7.18Centre-back: James Tarkowski, EvertonDespite their low position in the table, Everton boast one of the best defensive records in the Premier League – they have conceded fewer goals than Aston Villa and Tottenham. Tarkowski has been very important. The 31-year-old ranks fifth for clearances (127), third for aerial duels won (107) and second for interceptions (50) in the league. Rating: 7.07Centre-back: Jarrad Branthwaite, EvertonTarkowski’s teammate, Jarrad Branthwaite, partners him at the heart of our defence. Jarrad Branthwaite is enjoying a stunning campaign under Sean Dyche, with the 21-year-old deserving of his call-up to Gareth Southgate’s squad this month. The youngster will be a man in demand this summer, with his reading of the game belying his tender years. Branthwaite’s tally of 41 interceptions is especially impressive – only three players so young have made more in Europe’s top leagues this season. Rating: 6.88View image in fullscreenInfographic by WhoScoredCentral midfield: James Maddison, TottenhamOne of the signings of the season, James Maddison has been instrumental in Ange Postecoglou’s bright start as Tottenham boss. Maddison has scored four goals and set up seven more for Spurs in the Premier League. He is making 2.7 key passes per 90 minutes, the seventh highest in the league. Rating: 7.38Central midfield: Declan Rice, ArsenalAnother summer mover who is shining in new surroundings, Declan Rice has proven a sensational addition for Arsenal. Rice has been directly involved in 11 league goals this season, scoring six and setting up five, and he has added some necessary defensive resolve to Mikel Arteta’s side. Arsenal go into the international break top of the Premier League and Rice has made a big contribution to their success this season. Rating: 7.40Central midfield: Jude Bellingham, Real MadridJude Bellingham has taken to life at Real Madrid like a duck to water and could be England’s star player at the Euros in the summer. The 20-year-old has scored 16 goals in La Liga this season, earning Carlo Ancelotti’s side 11 additional points. He steps up at the big moments, which will be key when he goes back to Germany this summer. Rating: 7.78Right wing: Bukayo Saka, ArsenalThe best rated player in the Premier League this season, the Starboy is likely to be one of England’s star men this summer. Bukayo Saka is enjoying the best campaign of his career so far, with 13 goals and eight assists. He has made a massive contribution to Arsenal’s rise to top spot. Rating: 7.69Striker: Harry Kane, EnglandHarry Kane is the best rated player in Europe’s top five leagues this season and it is easy to see why. He has scored 31 league goals – his nearest competitor in the race for the European golden boot, Kylian Mbappé, has only scored 24. And the top scorer in the Premier League, Erling Haaland, is way back on 18. Kane has also contributed seven assists for Bayern. He might miss out on the friendlies this month due to an ankle injury sustained at the weekend, but he will be aiming to captain England to glory this summer. Rating: 7.87Left wing: Phil Foden, EnglandPhil Foden completes an impressive front three. He has appeared in all 28 of Manchester City’s league games this season, scoring 11 goals and setting up seven more. Foden was dubbed England’s great hope at Euro 2020, but his league form suggests he will live up to the billing at Euro 2024. Rating: 7.42The full 23-man squadGoalkeepers: Nick Pope, James Trafford, Jordan Pickford.Defenders: Kieran Trippier, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Ben White, James Tarkowski, Jarrad Branthwaite, Harry Maguire, Dan Burn.Midfielders: Jude Bellingham, James Maddison, Declan Rice, Ross Barkley, James Ward-Prowse, Conor Gallagher.Forwards: Harry Kane, Bukayo Saka, Phil Foden, Ollie Watkins, Eberechi Eze, Cole Palmer, Anthony Gordon.

 South America Football first came to South America in the 19th century through the port of Buenos Aires, Argentina, where European sailors played the game. Members of the British community there formed the first club, the Buenos Aires Football Club (FC), in 1867; about the same time, British railway workers started another club, in the town of Rosario, Argentina. The first Argentinian league championship was played in 1893, but most of the players belonged to the British community, a pattern that continued until the early 20th century. Brazil is believed to be the second South American country where the game was established. Charles Miller, a leading player in England, came to Brazil in 1894 and introduced football in São Paulo; that city’s athletic club was the first to take up the sport. In Colombia, British engineers and workers building a railroad near Barranquilla first played football in 1903, and the Barranquilla FBC was founded in 1909. In Uruguay, British railway workers were the first to play, and in 1891 they founded the Central Uruguay Railway Cricket Club (now the famous Peñarol), which played both cricket and football. In Chile, British sailors initiated play in Valparaíso, establishing the Valparaíso FC in 1889. In Paraguay, Dutchman William Paats introduced the game at a school where he taught physical education, but the country’s first (and still leading) club, Olimpia, was formed by a local man who became enthusiastic after seeing the game in Buenos Aires in 1902. In Bolivia the first footballers were a Chilean and students who had studied in Europe, and in Peru they were expatriate Britons. In Venezuela, British miners are known to have played football in the 1880s. Soon local people across South America began taking up and following the sport in ever greater numbers. Boys, mostly from poorer backgrounds, played from an early age, with passion, on vacant land and streets. Clubs and players gained popularity, and professionalism entered the sport in most countries around the 1930s—although many players had been paid secretly before then by their clubs. The exodus of South American players to European clubs that paid higher salaries began after the 1930 World Cup and has steadily increased. By the late 1930s, football had become a crucial aspect of popular culture in many South American nations; ethnic and national identities were constructed and played out on an increasingly international stage. In South American nations, nonwhite players fought a successful struggle to play at the top level: in Rio de Janeiro, Vasco da Gama was the first club to recruit Black players and promptly stormed to the league championship in 1923, encouraging other clubs to follow suit. In Uruguay, a nation of largely mixed European descent, local players learned both the physical style played by the English and the more refined passing game of the Scots, producing a versatility that helped their national team win two Olympic championships and the World Cup between 1924 and 1930.

 In 1916, South American countries were the first to hold a regular continental championship—later known as the Copa América. In 1960 the South American club championship (Libertadores Cup) was started; it has been played annually by the continent’s leading clubs (with the winner playing the European club champion), and, as a result of its popularity, various other international competitions have also been held between clubs. Domestic league championships are split into two or more tournaments each season with frequent variations in format. Eric Weil Richard C. Giulianotti   Africa European sailors, soldiers, traders, engineers, and missionaries brought football with them to Africa in the second half of the 19th century. The first documented match took place in Cape Town in 1862, after which the game spread rapidly throughout the continent, particularly in the British colonies and in societies with vibrant indigenous athletic traditions. During the interwar period, African men in cities and towns, railroad workers, and students organized clubs, associations, and regional competitions. Teams from Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia competed in the North African championship, established in 1919, and vied for the North African Cup, introduced in 1930. South of the Sahara, Kenya and Uganda first played for the Gossage Trophy in 1924, and the Darugar Cup was established on the island of Zanzibar. In the mining center of Élisabethville (now Lubumbashi, Congo) a football league for Africans was begun in 1925. In South Africa the game was very popular by the early 1930s, though it was organized in racially segregated national associations for whites, Africans, Coloureds (persons of mixed race), and Indians. In the colonies of British West Africa, the Gold Coast (now Ghana) launched its first football association in 1922, with Nigeria’s southern capital of Lagos following suit in 1931. Enterprising clubs and leagues developed across French West Africa in the 1930s, especially in Senegal and Côte d’Ivoire. Moroccan forward Larbi Ben Barek became the first African professional in Europe, playing for Olympique de Marseille and the French national team in 1938. After World War II football in Africa experienced dramatic expansion. Modernizing colonial regimes provided new facilities and created attractive competitions, such as the French West Africa Cup in 1947. The migration of talented Africans to European clubs intensified. Together with his elder compatriot Mario Coluña, Mozambican sensation Eusébio, European player of the year in 1965, starred for European champions Benfica of Lisbon and led Portugal to third place in the 1966 World Cup, where he was the tournament’s leading scorer. Algerian stars Rachid Mekhloufi of Saint-Étienne and Mustafa Zitouni of AS Monaco represented France before joining the team of the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) in 1958. The FLN eleven, who lost only 4 of 58 matches during the period 1958–62, embodied the close relations between nationalist movements and football in Africa on the eve of decolonization. With colonialism’s hold on Africa slipping away, the Confédération Africaine de Football (CAF) was established in February 1957 in Khartoum, Sudan, with the first African Cup of Nations tournament also played at that time. Independent African states encouraged football as a means of forging a national identity and generating international recognition. In the 1960s and early ’70s, African football earned a reputation for a spectacular, attacking style of play. African and European coaches emphasized craft, creativity, and fitness within solid but flexible tactical schemes. Salif Keita (Mali), Laurent Pokou (Côte d’Ivoire), and François M’Pelé (Congo [Brazzaville]) personified the dynamic qualities of football in postcolonial Africa. In the late 1970s, the migration of talented players overseas began hampering domestic leagues. The effects of this player exodus were somewhat tempered by the rise of “scientific football” and defensive, risk-averting tactics, an international trend that saw African players fall out of favor with European clubs. Even so, the integration of Africa and Africans into world football accelerated in the 1980s and ’90s. Cameroon’s national team, known as the Indomitable Lions, was a driving force in this process. After being eliminated without losing a match at the 1982 World Cup in Spain (tied with Italy in its group, Cameroon lost the tiebreaker on the basis of total goals scored), Cameroon reached the quarterfinals at the 1990 World Cup in Italy, thereby catapulting African football into the global spotlight. Nigeria then captured the Olympic gold medal in men’s football at the Summer Games in Atlanta in 1996; in 2000 Cameroon won its first Olympic gold medal in men’s football at the Games in Sydney, Australia. Success also came at youth level as Nigeria (1985) and Ghana (1991 and 1995) claimed under-17 world titles. Moreover, Liberian striker George Weah of Paris St. Germain received the prestigious FIFA World Player of the Year award in 1995. Michael EssienMichael Essien of Ghana jumping high for a header during a FIFA World Cup match against the United States in Nürnberg, Germany, on June 22, 2006.(more)In recognition of African football’s success and influence, FIFA awarded Africa five places in the 32-team 1998 World Cup finals. This achievement bore witness to African football’s phenomenal passion, growth, and development. This rich and complex history is made more remarkable by the continent’s struggles to cope with a fragile environment, scarce material resources, political conflicts, and the unpleasant legacy of imperialism. Peter Christopher Alegi   Asia and Oceania Football quickly entered Asia and Oceania in the latter half of the 19th century, but, unlike in Europe, it failed to become a unifying national sport. In Australia it could not dislodge the winter games of Australian rules football (codified before soccer) and rugby. British immigrants to Australia did relatively little to develop football locally. Because southern European immigrants were more committed to founding clubs and tournaments, football became defined as an “ethnic game.” As a result, teams from Melbourne and Sydney with distinctive Mediterranean connections were the most prominent members of the National Soccer League (NSL) when it started in 1977. The league has widened its scope, however, to include a highly successful Perth side, plus a Brisbane club and even one from Auckland, New Zealand. The NSL collapsed in 2004, but a new league, known as the A-League, emerged the next year. In New Zealand, Scottish players established clubs and tournaments from the 1880s, but rugby became the national passion. In Asia, during the same germinal period, British traders, engineers, and teachers set up football clubs in such colonial outposts as Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Burma (Myanmar). Yet football’s major problem across Asia, until the 1980s, was its failure to establish substantial roots among indigenous peoples beyond college students returning from Europe. Football in India was particularly prominent in Calcutta (Kolkata) among British soldiers, but locals soon adopted cricket. In Japan, Yokohama and Kobe housed large numbers of football-playing foreigners, but local people retained preferences for the traditional sport of sumo wrestling and the imported game of baseball. At the turn of the 21st century, football became increasingly important in Asian societies. In Iran, national team football matches became opportunities for many to express their reformist political views as well as for broad public celebration. The Iraqi men’s team’s fourth-place finish at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens struck a chord of hope for their war-torn homeland. The Asian game is organized by the Asian Football Confederation, comprising 47 members and stretching geographically from Lebanon in the Middle East to Guam in the western Pacific Ocean. The Asian Cup for national teams has been held quadrennially since 1956; Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Japan have dominated, with South Korea a regular runner-up. These countries have also produced the most frequent winners of the annual Asian Club Championship, first contested in 1967. Asian economic growth during the 1980s and early 1990s and greater cultural ties to the West helped cultivate club football. Japan’s J-League was launched in 1993, attracting strong public interest and a sprinkling of famous foreign players and coaches (notably from South America). Attendance and revenue declined from 1995, but the league survived and was reorganized into two divisions of 16 and 10 clubs, respectively, by 1999. The league grew to 30 teams by 2005 but had reduced to 18 by 2018. In 2024 there were 20 J-League teams. Some memorable international moments have indicated the potential of football in Asia and Oceania. Asia’s first notable success was North Korea’s stunning defeat of Italy at the 1966 World Cup finals. In 1994 Saudi Arabia became the first Asian team to qualify for the World Cup’s second round. The entertaining 2002 World Cup hosted by Japan and South Korea and the on-field success of the host nations’ national teams (South Korea reached the semifinals; Japan reached the second round) stood as the region’s brightest accomplishment in international football. Sawa HomareSawa Homare of INAC Kobe Leonessa in action during the Nadeshiko League football (soccer) match between INAC Kobe Leonessa and JEF United Ichihara Chiba Ladies at Home's Stadium Kobe in Kobe, Japan, July 24, 2011.(more)Football’s future in Asia and Oceania depends largely upon regular competition with top international teams and players. Increased representation in the World Cup finals has helped development of the sport in the region. Meanwhile, domestic club competitions across Asia and Oceania have been weakened by the need for top national players to join better clubs in Europe or South America to test and improve their talents at a markedly higher level. Qatar hosted the 2022 World Cup, which was the first World Cup held in the Middle East.

Arsenal have opened talks over bringing a €100 million striker to the Emirates Stadium this summer – for less than they imagined.The Gunners are enjoying a lengthy break before their next fixture against Manchester City in the Premier League, still fighting on domestic and European fronts. The acquisition of a top-level striker has been touted all season, with Eddie Nketiah tipped for an exit to make room for such a signing. Arsenal have reportedly told the academy graduate that he's “free to leave” just 18 months after signing his latest contract since he's struggled so much for game time – opening the door to a new superstar up front.Eddie Nketiah looks set to leave this summer (Image credit: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC via Getty Images)MilanLive.it in Italy have reported on a Gunners “offer” for Viktor Gyokeres of Sporting, who has a release clause of €100m, with TEAMtalk reporting that talks have begun.They add that a smaller fee of £75m may be enough to secure the Swede, claiming that Arsenal are in the “driving seat” for his signature. If the north Londoners are the only serious bidders willing to offer such an amount for Gyokeres, Sporting may look to accept the deal, knowing that they are still making a colossal profit.The striker left Coventry City for a record fee last summer, with the Championship side believed to hold a 10-15 per cent sell-on clause.Viktor Gyokeres is on Arsenal's radar (Image credit: Getty Images)The forward was named as FourFourTwo's EFL Player of the Year last season, saying at the time that, “It’s good to be in the conversation regarding Premier League teams, but right now we’re in the middle of the season.”Get the FourFourTwo NewsletterThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The 25-year-old is valued at €45m by Transfermarkt. More Arsenal storiesFormer Arsenal star: 'Thierry Henry couldn't believe I left for Barcelona'Why is Ben White not in the England squad?Arsenal striker hunt could mean another big deal with West Ham United: report

                  Joey Barton has been slammed after criticising England's stars, insinuating they are too concerned with their appearances and 'trying to look like Drake' to mount a serious challenge on the international stage. England are currently training at St. George's Park ahead of friendlies against Brazil and Belgium, with Gareth Southgate having named his squad last week for both games. However, three days before the first game against the South American giants at Wembley, there were four stars missing from the group, although it emerged they were training inside doing some physio and gym work, rather than nursing injuries.   Photos have been released of Southgate's men as preparations continue, however the outspoken Barton was far from pleased by what he saw. 'Culture is all wrong. Training in diamond earrings and leggings. Won’t win a sausage!' he wrote on X, formerly Twitter.           Joey Barton was far from pleased by pictures that emerged of the England training camp         Barton claimed the squad were too interested in their appearances to win anything

'Too many weak, disingenuous men in positions of leadership. More a***d about looking like the rapper Drake than the great Bobby Moore.'The image Barton commented on featured a picture of Manchester City's Kyle Walker, who most recently won a historic treble for Barton's former side under Pep Guardiola. And social media users were quick to ridicule Barton, 41, for his post - pointing out the difference in individual honours between him and the Man City star.'Joey Barton is saying Kyle Walker won’t win a sausage because of his earring. Kyle Walker has won the premier league (5x), FA Cup (2x), league cup (4x) and the champions league,' one fan on X wrote.'He also has an array of individual awards. Joseph Barton won the championship.'Another said: 'According to Joey Barton, you'll never win with with Kyle Walker because he has an earring and wears leggings in training. The same Kyle Walker who has a trophy ROOM because one cabinet just ain't cutting it any more.'A third user wrote, 'Joey Barton trying to slag off Kyle Walker who’s literally won everything at club level,' before adding a clown emoji.'Yeah I’m sure Kyle Walker, a treble winner, multiple caps for England, is gonna take football advice from Joey Barton,' a fourth wrote.Barton did give effusive praise to Jude Bellingham, who he claimed was England's best shot at success.                                     Fans on X were quick to point out the difference in the number of trophies won by Walker compared to Barton'No earrings, no leggings, proper kid. I hope they all follow him,' he added.'He's the best best chance we have of winning anything. The rest of them, not worth a carrot. All wanting to be rappers.'Bellingham was pictured in similar England gear to his team-mates, running what appeared to be a passing drill ahead of Saturday's game. The Real Madrid midfielder comes into the squad as one of the leading stars in Europe after an outstanding start to his career in the Spanish capital. He is the leading goal scorer in LaLiga with 16 strikes plus three assists as he thrives in a young midfield featuring Eduardo Camavinga and Aurelien Tchouameni, under the watchful eyes of veterans Toni Kroos and Luka Modric. The Three Lions head to Germany this summer as one of the sure-fire favourites to go all the way, alongside rivals France, thanks to the strength in depth they can boast.         Barton reacted to a picture of Walker from the training session claiming players were trying to look like 'Drake'                  Jude Bellingham came in for some praise from the former Bristol Rovers manager         Bellingham has starred in his first season for Real Madrid and is the current top scorer in LaLiga         Kylian Mbappe (right) and France are thought to be favourites alongside England to go all the wayEngland manager Southgate has seen his squad depleted by injuries and will be crossing his fingers that he can at least call upon his captain for the fixtures.The games against Brazil and Belgium are Southgate's final opportunities to assess his players before naming his squad for this summer's European Championship in Germany.On Tuesday, Manchester United star Kobbie Mainoo was handed his first ever senior England call-up ahead of their upcoming friendlies.The 18 year old was initially part of the Under-21 squad but has been drafted into Southgate's group for their matches later this month.England FootballGareth SouthgateDrake

Many industries are understandably cautious at the moment, as they steel themselves for more tricky economic times ahead. But it seems that nobody told the English Premier League – which has just broken its own record for spending money on football players – to the tune of £1.9 billion.  
Of the top 20 most expensive European club signings this summer, 15 were in the Premier League (four were in Spain’s La Liga, and one in Germany’s Bundesliga). Overall, the Premier League spent more than the top divisions in France, Spain and Italy combined. 
This level of spending is not new. In the 2017-2018 season, the Premier League spent £1.86 billion, equivalent to more than £2 billion today. But what might be different this time is the potential impact on increasing the level of competition throughout the league.
For the (financial) value of playing talent is now more evenly distributed across Premier League clubs, which in theory could lead to more competitive balance. Figures suggest a large net transfer of spending by clubs outside of the “big six” (Manchester City, Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool). 





In particular, West Ham, Newcastle and newly promoted Nottingham Forest have been some of the bigger spenders, to the extent that the estimated market value of Premier League clubs is now more evenly distributed than in any of the last ten seasons. 
Historically, more even distribution of playing talent means a more even distribution of league points, so the competitive balance of the league may well be about to improve. 
That’s all very well for the 20 clubs in the top tier of English football, but the gulf between the Premier League and the second tier, the Championship, is now larger than ever. The gap in transfer spending is now £1.3bn, three times what it was ten seasons ago. 
That gap gets even greater when you move into the third and fourth tiers (League One and League Two), which respectively have estimated market values of just 2.4% and 0.9% of the Premier League. This creates significant financial barriers to entry to the top tier, which should be a real concern for both clubs and football fans.
For English football has a systemic problem when it comes to financial sustainability. A large number of clubs spend many times more than what they earn and frequently require cash injections from their owners. And while there are various financial rules in place for football clubs, every team is well aware of the direct correlation that exists between spending on players and the chance of winning matches. 
A tactical approach
So victory is expensive. But overspending can be ruinous, as fans of clubs which have gone into administration, like Wigan and Derby County, will attest. Our research showed that even big clubs’ resilience to economic shocks has been historically poor, so football is far from immune to current global difficulties.

Last year, the fan-led review of football governance was published, followed by a government response which aimed to bring greater financial stability to all English clubs, provide the lower leagues with more financial support, and encourage the development of English footballers. One of the key recommendations was the introduction of an independent regulator with monitoring powers over football’s poor finances.
However, it has been reported that the new UK prime minister, Liz Truss, may not be inclined to implement these recommendations. If she doesn’t, more clubs may well be at risk from an imbalance that brings grave risks for the smaller and poorer clubs.
But the big spending in the Premier League has benefits that we should not ignore. The league itself funds grassroots football and charities, and has recently increased spending on women’s football development. Meanwhile, the clubs each have a charitable foundation or trust, which contribute towards youth education schemes and other positive social causes. The money earned by well run clubs can be put to good use. 
Transfer spending is a cost, yes, but it also brings significant financial benefits to the club which sells a player, and those benefits can be far reaching. Whether these levels of spending are sustainable and fair in the long term is another matter – and that must surely be the goal.

England’s impressive Euro 2020 qualifier victories have confirmed that the country is having a great moment in football. The Lions were unusually confident in both matches, putting five goals past both the Czech Republic and Montenegro. Young English players are also in high demand outside the UK right now: Borussia Dortmund are battling to hang on to Jadon Sancho after an eye-catching first full season in the German Bundesliga, while Bayern Munich are among the European clubs trying to lure his England teammate Callum Hudson-Odoi from Chelsea. 
These are signs that England’s youth academies are delivering after years of struggling to catch up with continental rivals, while Sancho’s success at Dortmund is a reminder that English players don’t always have to break into the Premier League to make it to the top. Yet as this recent report confirms, England still lacks homegrown talent in its top league. This prevents young players from hitting the big time, and it’s getting worse. 



Concerned: Gareth Southgate.

Players that grew up in the UK contributed just 35% of playing time in this season’s Premier League, down from 40% in 2009-10. Their proportion of goals fell from 39% to 31%, while player contributions from Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales are now barely in single percentage figures. England manager Gareth Southgate has raised concerns about this on numerous occasions since his team finished fourth in the Russia World Cup last summer. He argues that the lack of first-team football for many of the country’s brightest prospects is narrowing his selection options. 
In fact, this is not entirely an English problem. There has been a steady increase in expat players across Europe’s top divisions, rising from 35% to 40% between 2009 and 2018. Other national coaches, such as Italy’s Roberto Mancini, have voiced concerns, too. Of the major leagues, however, the English Premier League is the most expat of all: 59% compared to Italy’s 54%, Germany’s 49%, Spain’s 39% and France’s 36%. 





The Premier League problem
The Premier League’s success since its 1992 inception has certainly made it harder for young homegrown players to transition to first-team football at the highest level. In such a competitive league, where clubs have huge funds, managers and football directors always want the best possible “ready to use” talent from around the world. 
English membership of the EU single market – we’ll see what happens after Brexit – makes it particularly easy to get players from Europe. And with so many continental managers at Premier League clubs working under enormous pressure, it’s only reasonable they sign players they know well. 
Southgate for one is not convinced it’s a simple quality problem. As he put it:

Nobody can tell me that, if [English] players are good enough, they will come through. That is not true. There are plenty of players who are good enough.

If so, we must ask what else could be done to boost the chances of aspiring Lions. One major difference between England and certain continental countries is there are no “B” teams of major clubs in lower divisions. In Spain, Portugal, Germany and Ukraine, this makes it easier to integrate young players into a club’s top team. Italy is now trying this too, with Juventus B launching in the country’s third tier, Serie C, this season.

Unlike the reserve teams or under-23 teams common in England, B teams arguably give young players more playing time at a higher competitive level. There are also advantages over England’s system of loaning out players to lesser clubs or of using feeder clubs in the way that Liverpool takes players from Genk of Belgium, or Chelsea from Vitesse Arnhem in the Netherlands: being part of the same club structure and training in the same environment arguably allows for enhanced internal mobility and increases the chances for opportunities in the first team. 
The potential of B teams also extends to managers: after a difficult start to the season, Benfica replaced Rui Vitoria with B team manager Bruno Lage. Legends like Zinedine Zidane and Pep Guardiola also developed their coaching skills in these secondary set ups, previously managing Real Madrid Castilla and Barcelona B respectively – indeed, Guardiola himself has made the case for B teams in England in the past. 
The Portuguese experience
Portugal seems the most visible success story with B teams to date. In 2012, the Primeira Liga clubs were invited to create secondary teams that would be directly entered into the country’s second tier, Ledman Liga Pro, but wouldn’t be eligible for promotion. Porto, Benfica, Sporting, Braga, Vitória SC and Maritimo all took this up.  
A recent report by the Portuguese League revealed that nine out of the 23 Portugal players that became European champions at Euro 2016 in France played for their club’s B team as part of their transition into first-team football. Even more noticeably, 20 of the 21 Portuguese players that made the quarter finals in the 2017 Under-20 World Cup in South Korea were playing for a B team. It’s also having a big effect in club football: for example, Benfica’s recent 3-0 Europa League victory against Dinamo Zagreb included five players who were in their B team last season. 



Next stop the quarter finals: Benfica overcoming Dinamo Zagreb.

Introducing this system to England is not without risks. Take FIFA’s plan to limit the number of players clubs can send out on loan each season to between six and eight: richer clubs may use B teams as an instrument to bypass this new rule. There is a wider danger that other parts of the football ecosystem will suffer if B teams allow major clubs to become even more self-contained. 
Critics of this system have also made the point that B teams in Portugal and elsewhere can struggle to compete, but that loses sight of the main goal of helping younger players reach the top. 
On the whole, the B team system looks like a valuable and growing part of international football that England should think seriously about adopting – especially at a time when Brexit and UEFA’s Financial Fair Play restrictions will be making clubs reconsider their future options. 
Southgate has said that where so many of the things that used to be wrong with English football have now been put right, the proportion of homegrown players in the Premier League “is just the missing piece”. If the likes of Manchester City B and Liverpool B were taking part in lower-league fixtures week in week out, this puzzle might finally be completed.

Mention the words ‘Bayern Munich’ and what comes to mind? A teutonic powerhouse? One of Europe’s elite? Serial winners? The Bavarians are, after all, a team that has won the Bundesliga 31 times – when the first was only 55 years ago.
It is a team that has won the European Cup six times and includes such notable alumni as Franz Beckenbauer, Gerd Muller, Sepp Maier, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Lothar Matthaus and Philipp Lahm. It is a world-famous brand that stands for excellence. Bayern Munich equals trophies and success.
But hard as it is to believe, they have endured ups and downs just like all teams – the difference being that a Bayern “down” is still normally what most other teams dream about.
But there is one season that will always live in infamy in Bayern history, a season during the 1990s when they were, frankly speaking, pretty terrible. Of course, terrible for Die Roten is relative – we are not talking about relegation here – but by their lofty standards, they turned into a mediocre team for 12 months. The season in question took place across 1991/92.
What’s more surprising is that there was no immediate sign beforehand of the slump to come. The 1986/87 campaign had seen an Udo Lattek-led Bayern win the Bundesliga, the manager whom Die Roten had dominated Europe under in the 1970s.
That proved to be his final season before being replaced by Jupp Heynckes, who ironically had also replaced Lattek when he became Borussia Monchengladbach manager in 1979. While unable to replicate the Foals’ amazing 1970s success, Heynckes did lead them to fourth-place finishes in 1985 and 1986, followed by third place in 1987 along with a UEFA Cup semi-final, putting him on Bayern’s radar. 
Heynckes’ debut season (1987/88) saw Bayern fail to retain their title as an emergent Werder Bremen secured glory under the stewardship of Otto Rehhagel. With strikers Karl-Heinz Riedle and Frank Neubarth, and a defence that conceded just 22 goals in 34 games, Bremen finished four points ahead of second-place Bayern, having beaten them 3-1 in a key week 26 meeting. But normal service was soon resumed as Bayern lifted the Bundesliga the following year while also reaching the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup.
The 1989/90 season saw Bayern even more dominant, again winning the Bundesliga by six points while this time reaching the semi-finals of the European Cup, before falling to the AC Milan of the three Dutch masters. Looking at the squad that season, it is notable that there were no world-renowned stars. The strike duo of Roland Wohlfarth and Alan McInally, while efficient, were hardly names that would’ve had Baresi, Maldini and co worried. But it was still enough to dominate Germany.
As such, the summer of 1990 saw Heynckes strengthen the squad by bringing in Stefan Effenberg, Brian Laudrup and Christian Ziege. Of these, the signing of Effenberg was by far the most interesting. A player who throughout his career would be no stranger to controversy, he was asked about why he had decided to join Bayern. Sporting his blonde mullet, he replied, “Because the other clubs are too stupid to win the Bundesliga.”
It was a surefire way to place a target on your back for the season, a comment sure to have been posted on opposing dressing room walls, including Kaiserslautern’s. An early season league game saw Bayern hammer Kaiserslautern 4-0 at the Olympiastadion before the season then developed into a battle between both teams for the title.
Late March saw the advantage swing to Kaiserslautern as they defeated Bayern 2-1 at home courtesy of a late winner from Stefan Kuntz. That sparked a strong run from Die Roten and, with three matches to go, things were tight.
Bayern then travelled to Bochum to face little-fancied Wattenscheid – a team that played in the tiny Lohrheidestadion and who Bayern had beaten 7-0 earlier in the season. To the shock of a watching nation, Wattenscheid held a 2-1 lead as the game entered the dying minutes. Then, with just three minutes left, the ever-reliable Wohlfarth scored to save Bayern’s blushes. Or so it seemed.
Two minutes later, Thorsten Fink scored a shock winner for the team from Bochum to send 35,000 fans delirious – a defeat that opened the door for Kaiserslautern to claim their first Bundesliga title.
As if the defeat to Wattenscheid wasn’t painful enough, Bayern also suffered heartache in the European Cup. Once again, the semi-final curse raised its head, this time to Eastern European opposition rather than Italian. A strong team had emerged at Red Star Belgrade, who came to Munich and left with a 2-1 win in the first leg of their semi-final clash.
That left Bayern with a tough assignment in front of 80,000 rabid Red Star fans – flares burning in an intimidating atmosphere. But Die Roten rose to the task and the game was about to enter extra-time with Bayern 2-1 up when a freak own goal from captain Klaus Augenthaler in the last minute saw the Yugoslavs grab the all-important equaliser and move on to the final. 
So as 1991/92 commenced, Bayern came off disappointment at the end of the preceding season but had still finished second in the league and narrowly missed on a European Cup final appearance. It was a season that many teams would die for.
The squad development continued as Heynckes brought in players such as Jan Wouters, Oliver Kreuzer, Thomas Berthold and two Brazilians, Mazinho and Bernardo. But balancing that was the retirement of long-serving stalwart Augenthaler. Still, Bayern fans were looking forward to reclaiming their position at the top of the league while perhaps claiming a UEFA Cup title. 
The opening two league games saw an inauspicious start as Bayern drew at Werder Bremen before losing at home to Bundesliga new boys Hansa Rostock. They then travelled to Dusseldorf and came away with their first win, albeit only 1-0 thanks to a last-minute winner from Mazinho. Fans could start to relax ahead of a straightforward cup tie at home against minnows FC Homburg.
Homburg is a small town in the Saarland region of Germany and their local team had been relatively obscure for most of its history. But, in 1986, they had reached the Promised Land of the Bundesliga for the first time. Their fans enjoyed two seasons at the top table before being relegated and then returning immediately. And so, travelling to Munich, the team was a second-tier outfit who typically played in front of 8,000 fans, even when in the Bundesliga. 
Only 9,000 bothered to trek to the Olympiastadion to watch the tie, resulting in a strange atmosphere within the vast bowl. It took 27 minutes but Bayern grabbed the lead through a backpost header from Mazinho. So far, so good. But Homburg emerged in the second half revitalised and had the cheek to equalise via a powerful shot from Rodolfo Cardoso.
Worse was to come for Bayern as, with just 13 minutes remaining, a loose ball fell to Homburg’s Matthias Baranowski, who gladly accepted the gift. This was not in the Bayern script and could not be permitted. Unsurprisingly, while Homburg fans were still rubbing their eyes, Mazinho scored again. Enough of this nonsense.
And so the game went into extra-time when Bayern’s fitness would surely overwhelm the underdogs. But just five minutes in, Homburg’s Michael Kimmel jinked into the area and scored with a low shot. That pesky Homburg side just didn’t know when to lie down. And if that wasn’t bad enough, they then scored again four minutes later through Bernd Gries. Bayern were 4-2 down at home. That was how the game would end. A shocked Bayern had been eliminated in their first cup game by a lower division team in their own stadium.
Sometimes a cup defeat can be a blessing in disguise – at least now they could focus on the league and UEFA Cup. Maybe all was not lost yet.
Their league form continued to fluctuate and, after nine matches, Bayern sat in seventh place as they prepared to commence their continental campaign. A relatively easy first-round draw saw them due to travel to Ireland for a first leg against Cork City. As Bayern fans researched where Cork was on the map, the players flew over. 
Cork City had only formed in 1984, following the bankruptcy of Cork United in 1982. A second-place league finish in the previous season had seen the part-timers earn their spot in the UEFA Cup. In front of just 4,000 fans, it was time for Bayern to forget about the Homburg embarrassment and start a successful UEFA Cup campaign.
Dave Barry was a local who enjoyed a successful career with Cork County, playing Gaelic Football and winning two All-Ireland medals. But he also enjoyed regular football on the side and so turned out for Cork City as a midfielder. Ahead of the game, he had somehow come to the attention of Effenberg who, with his normal diplomacy, compared him to his grandfather.
Picked for the game against Bayern, he wrote his name into Irish folklore when, after just 26 minutes, Cork stole the ball from the advancing Bayern defence and Barry found it at his feet. Charging forward, the balding midfielder turned inside one defender before rifling a shot home. The fans went ballistic.
And so it stood until just before half-time when Effenberg finally brought parity to the score. Everyone then braced for the second-half whirlwind from Bayern, but it never occurred. The part-timers of Cork ended with a famous 1-1 draw against the German giants.
The second leg saw Bayern struggle once more. In fact, the Irish part-timers held out until the 71st minute before Bruno Labbadia finally spared Bayern’s blushes. A last-gasp penalty added a little more gloss, but at the final whistle, Die Roten had only just got over the line. Considering this and the Homburg result, all was most definitely not well in Bavaria.
Three days later, Bayern travelled to Stuttgart and were hammered 4-1 – not by VfB but rather by Stuttgarter Kickers. It was finally too much to bear and, three days later, Bayern announced that they were parting company with Heynckes.
The former striking great went on to enjoy a long and successful managerial career, overseeing teams in Spain, Portugal and Germany, including Real Madrid, Benfica, Schalke and his first love, Borussia Monchengladbach. He even returned to Bayern, becoming caretaker manager in 2009 after the firing of Jurgen Klinsmann before replacing Louis van Gaal in 2011 and leading them to a Champions League final defeat to Chelsea.
He then giuded Bayern to glory in 2013 by defeating Bundesliga rivals Borussia Dortmund in the final, making Heynckes just the fourth manager to win the competition with two different teams, Real Madrid being the other. One of the all-time greats, his dismissal after the Kickers defeat was later described by general manager Uli Hoeness as “the biggest mistake I ever made in my business life”.
A meeting was set up with club legend Franz Beckenbauer in Munich’s Sheraton Hotel to offer him the position as head coach. But he declined, stating prior commitments made it impossible. And therefore Bayern turned elsewhere – with a somewhat surprising result.
Replacing Heynckes at the helm would be Danish legend Soren Lerby. A player who enjoyed three seasons with Bayern, during which they won two Bundesliga titles, he had only recently retired from playing at the age of 32. Taking the Bayern job represented his first step into management – a daunting task for experienced heads let alone a rookie. He didn’t even have the required coaching licence at the time of his appointment. It seemed a strange choice to most fans. 
His tenure started off shakily as Bayern lost successive league games against Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart to drop to 14th in the 20-team league, just three places above the relegation spots. Next up for Lerby was, ironically, a trip back to Denmark as Bayern had drawn Boldklubben 1903 in the second round of the UEFA Cup. If Lerby thought it would be an enjoyable trip home, he was in for a major surprise.
Not even the most hardcore Boldklubben fans can claim that their team had a grand history. They had won the league seven times, but four of those were before World War Two, while the most recent was back in 1976, before then merging with Kjobenhavns Boldklub in 1992 to form FC Copenhagen, who have enjoyed considerable success since.
They had only ever won two European ties and never made it past the second round. The visit of Bayern would represent one of the last games that Boldklubben would play before the merger. And what a game it was.
Over 14,000 fans packed into the Gentofte Stadion to see how their boys would fare against the German powerhouse. For 30 minutes the game was a stalemate, until Bayern snatched the lead through Mazinho. That lead lasted just five minutes before Michael Manniche tied the game. Tied going into the half-time break, there was little indication of the shockwave to come.
After 57 minutes, Boldklubben earned a penalty, which was duly dispatched by Danish star Ivan Nielsen. Four minutes later, the fans were in ecstasy as Kenneth Wegner made it 3-1. As the ground began to shake, the madness continued; just three minutes later, Manniche grabbed a second to put the Danes 4-1 up. The mighty Bayern had just conceded three goals in the space of seven minutes. And it wasn’t over yet.
Brian Klaus added a fifth before Peter Uldbjerg made it 6-1. No-one could quite believe what they were witnessing. Markus Munch pulled back a last-minute consolation for Bayern but, as the final whistle sounded, all eyes turned to the scoreboard: Boldklubben 1903 6-2 Bayern Munich. Bayern’s season had just truly imploded.
The return leg two weeks later saw Die Roten exit the competition with a whimper, winning just 1-0 through a late Mazinho goal. They had now been eliminated from the DFB-Pokal at home by a lower division side, from the UEFA Cup by Danish minnows and were sitting in 14th place in the league.
Given this start, it was no real surprise that Lerby was a dead man walking. He managed to stumble on until March when a 4-0 defeat away at Kaiserslautern saw Bayern, still stuck in the lower half of the table, finally wield the axe. It was to represent Lerby’s only stint in football management.
It was time for a third manager that season as Hoeness turned to a much more experienced hire in Erich Ribbeck. 
Ribbeck had started his managerial career back in 1967 at Rot-Weiss Essen before managing Eintracht Frankfurt, Kaiserslautern, Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen. His stats to date were at best mediocre – the only trophy he won during that period was the UEFA Cup with Bayer Leverkusen in 1988 – but he had Bundesliga experience and so was seen as the man who could right the listing ship.
But Bayern by now were in a complete funk and so Ribbeck oversaw a final 11 league games in which they won five but lost as many as they stumbled over the finishing line, mired in mediocrity.
With the season over, Bayern sat in tenth, exactly mid-table. They had lost more games than they had won, including seven at home, and finished with a -2 goal difference. As usual, Wohlfarth was top scorer with 17, followed by Mazinho (12) and Effenberg (11). They had to sit back and watch while VfB Stuttgart, Dortmund and Frankfurt played out final-day drama to captivate the whole country.
All three teams sat on 50 points going into the final matchday and all three were playing away from home. Frankfurt had goal difference advantage and just needed to win, but shockingly lost to Hansa Rostock while having a clear penalty denied to them at 1-1.
Dortmund won at Duisburg and were two minutes from being Bundesliga champions before Guido Buchwald wrote himself into Stuttgart legend with an 88th-minute winner at Leverkusen – despite being down to ten men following the sending-off of Matthias Sammer – earning Stuttgart the title on goal difference. 
That summer saw Bayern spend big. In came Thomas Helmer, Jorginho, Mehmet Scholl and, most newsworthy, the return of the prodigal son, Lothar Matthaus. Laudrup and Effenberg were moved on to Fiorentina to help fund the rebuild.
It worked: Bayern finished second in the Bundesliga, just a point behind champions Werder Bremen and with just five losses and a +29 goal difference. Ribbeck had successfully steadied the ship and would soon retire, replaced by Beckenbauer before a disastrous spell as Germany manager from 1998 to 2000. But Ribbeck also left with the unenviable stat of becoming the first and only manager of Bayern to be in charge for over 500 days without winning a single trophy.
To this day, the 1991/92 season stands as a nadir for Bayern. Since the, Die Roten have only ever finished outside the top three twice, and have won 12 Bundesliga titles and three Champions Leagues. While 90s was often an inconsistent decade for Bayern – with players more often featured in the gossip pages rather than the sports pages, leading to the famous “FC Hollywood” nickname – nothing was as bad as 1991/92. 
Bayern will always represent one of the elite European teams and are the gold standard against which many others measure themselves. Moreover, they have enjoyed success without the huge external financial backing that some other European sides have enjoyed.
It has been argued by many that their recent dominance of German football has spoilt the Bundesliga as a spectacle, especially considering their ten successive. But it is refreshing to know that even teams like Bayern Munich can experience a season of woe. For that one year, they were actually human after all. And for that, VfB Stuttgart, Homborg, Cork City and Boldklubben will be eternally grateful.

Pelé at the 1970 World Cup: the memories beyond the goals

Pelé at the 1970 World Cup: the memories beyond the goals

Every four years, strikers from a host of countries converge on that ultimate festival of football: the World Cup. For many, this represents the pinnacle of their careers to date, the chance to prove themselves against the best and to write themselves into history. And each World Cup throws up a forward who is forever associated with that competition; often one goal in particular that lives on in collective memories.
Go right back to 1962 and we see Garrincha score a thundering shot against England in the quarter-finals. 1966 sees an exhausted Geoff Hurst hurtle towards goal before unleashing a piledriver past Hans Tilkowski – a shot that he later admitted was hit as hard as it was so that if he likely missed, it would eat up time recovering the ball.
In 1974, Gerd Muller shows his predatory instincts to spin on a dime and cause Dutch heartache. Four years later, Mario Kempes bursts through the Netherlands defence, hair billowing behind him. The list goes on: Paolo Rossi in 1982 against Brazil; Diego Maradona in 1986 against England; Roberto Baggio in 1990 against Czechoslovakia.
What these all have in common is forwards scoring goals that are forever remembered from those respective tournaments and often the first thing that you will think off when someone mentions their name and the competition. If I simply say the words 1998 and Zinedine Zidane, it’s likely your first thought is of his two goals in the final.
The list above has deliberately excluded one World Cup, the 1970 edition in Mexico. Yes that beautiful World Cup that was the first in colour with the shimmering heat haze and crackling commentary. And if you play the word association game once again and ask someone what first pops into their head when you mention that competition, the likely answer is Brazil.
Indeed, if you then ask them to name one player from that team, it is odds on they are going to say Pelé. Because while the Brazil side that won the tournament were arguably the greatest national team of all time (Hungary 1954 and the Netherlands 1974 might like to debate that), one player still managed to stand out from such illustrious company.
Just how great a striker was Pelé? Well, let’s start with 501 goals in 493 appearances for Santos between 1956 and 1974 – so yes, averaging a goal a game for 18 years. Ah, but I hear you say, ‘that is in the Brazilian league, which surely is not the same standard as European leagues?’ That is open to debate, particularly given the number of world-class footballers within the competition at the time.
Let’s then consider Pelé’s international record of 77 goals in 92 games. That includes playing in four World Cups against the top teams of those times. Faced with statistics such as those, it is hard not to argue that Pelé was extremely good at putting the ball into the net.
But that leads to an interesting observation. There is no doubt that the 1970 World Cup and Pelé are intertwined in people’s memories. One of the greatest goalscorers of all-time helped his side lift the trophy with four goals across the tournament, but oddly enough if you again ask people the first five things that come into their head when you say Pelé and 1970, I think you would be surprised to find that not a single one of them would be a goal scored by him.
Unlike the other strikers mentioned earlier, Pelé’s fame in 1970 actually came more from misses than goals. Yes, one of the greatest goalscorers is actually remembered better for misses and saves.
 
Memory 1: June 3, 1970
 
Brazil’s opening match of the tournament sees them pitted against a decent Czechoslovakia team. The game is only three minutes old when a ball across the area finds Pelé unmarked in front of an open goal, who then proceeds to place the ball over the bar. That miss is then compounded by the Czechs having the cheek to take the lead after just 11 minutes. Things are not going according to plan. But Brazil begin to regain their composure and, after 23 minutes, Rivellino thunders in a trademark free-kick. 
As half-time approaches, Pelé receives the ball within the Brazil half and surveys the scene while moving slowly towards the centre circle. Then, suddenly, he smashes the ball goalwards. As the camera follows the flight of the ball, it picks up the Czech goalkeeper, Ivo Viktor, furiously backpedalling. In that split second after receiving the ball, Pelé has noticed Viktor has strayed forward from his goalline and decided to attempt to lob him. The Brazilian commentator describes the action perfectly: “Pele, Pele, Pele … almost,” as the ball just goes wide of the post.
It is important to bear in mind the context of this attempt. This is not a league match against Wimbledon where you are 2-0 up in injury time, so why the hell not have a go; this is an opening World Cup tie in which you are level. To even attempt such a lob on such a stage shows the audacity of Pelé. That is strengthened by the fact that, even though he actually missed, it is still remembered by all. Yes, David Beckham’s lob was fantastic, but he was standing on the shoulders of Pele.
 
Memory 2: June 7, 1970
 
Brazil end up with an emphatic 4-1 victory over Czechoslovakia, including a goal from Pelé before being overshadowed by a double from Jairzinho. But they face stiff competition in their group by being drawn alongside the reigning champions England, who arguably have a better team now than in ’66. And so the second match of the group between the two teams is always going to be critical in terms of who advances top.
The game kicks off at noon under a scorching Mexican sun – advantage Brazil in terms of weather. Just seeing a red-headed, freckled Alan Ball chasing the ball is the ultimate advert for sun cream.
Just nine minutes into the game, Carlos Alberto moves towards the halfway line with the ball before hitting a great pass into the stride of Jairzinho, who then beats Terry Cooper to take the ball to the byline before hitting a cross to the back post. And there is Pelé, who powers a header downwards towards the corner at a horrible height for any goalkeeper. But the ‘keeper happens to be Gordon Banks, who somehow gets across from the near post to the far. He doesn’t just palm it out but scoops it over the bar. Enter immortality. 
As time progresses, the cult of the Banks save grows. It steadily becomes referred to as the greatest save of all time – as if that is something that anyone is really fit to judge. I personally would argue that Jim Montgomery’s double save against Leeds in the 1973 FA Cup final could give it a run for its money. But the moniker has stuck – aided in England by David Coleman’s commentary of the save being sampled into ‘Three Lions’.
 
Memory 3: June 7, 1970
 
They say a picture tells a thousand words. During the course of football history, there have been many iconic images – Maradona facing five Belgian defenders or Baggio hands on hips after his penalty miss – but one of the most famous is that of Pelé and Bobby Moore embracing at the end of the Brazil-England game. Embracing may be too strong a word given that it involves an Englishman in the 1970s, but there is a definite tenderness in the way Pelé touches Moore’s face while the latter clutches the Brazilian’s discarded shirt proudly in his hand. 
It is an image of two legendary players who know that they have just been involved in a titanic struggle. It is an image of pure mutual respect. After all, in a game that, according to the English, had already produced “the greatest save of all time”, it had also, according to the English once again, produced “the greatest tackle of all time” by Moore on Jairzinho. It’s another moment sampled into ‘Three Lions’, ensuring it lives on for generations.
 
Memory 4: June 17, 1970
 
Brazil end up winning all their group games and then proceed to eliminate a useful Peru side in the quarter-finals. Standing between them and a World Cup final are their old foes, Uruguay. It has to be remembered that it was Uruguay who crushed the Brazilian nation by defeating them 2-1 in the 1950 World Cup at the Maracanã. Therefore any big game against Uruguay was always going to cause heightened tension for fans of O Seleção.
The game did not disappoint in that respect with Uruguay taking an early lead. As the half wore on, thoughts must have been flooding back to 1950. Surely Brazil’s greatest side weren’t going to be undone by their tiny neighbours again? But an equaliser just before half-time helped soothe frayed nerves.
With 15 minutes remaining, Brazil finally take the lead through a beautiful Jairzinho goal. A sigh of relief ripples through their fans, but is tempered by the memory that they also led at one stage during the Maracanazo. And so nerves continue to jangle until, with just one minute remaining, Pelé runs at the Uruguayan defence before setting up Rivellino to put the game beyond doubt.
As injury time commences, Brazil look home and dry. As the crowd awaits the final whistle, a through ball from Tostão puts Pelé though onto goal. The goalkeeper, Ladislao Mazurkiewicz, rushes out but it appears that Pelé will get to the ball first. Then it should just be a matter of touching it past the ‘keeper and rolling the ball into the unguarded net for the icing on the cake.
But this is Pelé, a player whose genius almost produced a halfway-line goal earlier in the tournament. To just go around the ‘keeper would be too straightforward. After all, Brazil have won the game. So instead, while running at full speed, Pelé just steps over the ball and lets it run on past a stunned Mazurkiewicz who is stranded in no-man’s land. Quick as you like, Pelé then spins to the right to chase the ball, hits it towards the net, and watches the ball roll agonisingly just wide of the post. It is a move that takes the breath away in a similar fashion to the Cruyff turn in 1974 and is perhaps the greatest goal that never was.
 
Memory 5: June 21, 1970
 
And so Brazil progress to the World Cup final and a date with Italy. The biggest stage in world football. After 18 minutes, Pelé opens the scoring with a header at the far post. But an equaliser by Roberto Boninsegna – he of the Coke can fame – sees the sides level at half-time. Thereafter, goals from Gerson and Jairzinho put Brazil firmly back in the driving seat.As the match approaches the end, Brazilian songs fill the Mexican air.
But there is one more moment of greatness to savour. Brazil retrieve the ball near their own penalty area and start to pass it around with one-touch football. The ball falls to Clodoaldo who almost drunkenly weaves past four Italian players before laying it off to Rivellino, who immediately passes it directly forward to the feet of Jairzinho. He brings the ball across the penalty area and then spots Pelé to his right. A short pass later and O Rei has the ball facing the goal just outside the area with an Italian defender before him.
We’ve all tried it during five-a-side or a Sunday league game – the infamous no-look pass. It is up there with the nutmeg as the ultimate flashy move. With a sixth sense, Pelé just holds the ball momentarily while, behind him, Carlos Alberto is streaking forward on his right-hand side. A heartbeat later and Pelé rolls the ball so, so casually to the right, sensing that Alberto is arriving. And without having to break stride at all, he drills the ball in at full speed. Brazil are world champions once again.
And the final, iconic images of the World Cup are of Brazilian fans rushing onto the field and basically stripping the players of all their kit as souvenirs. Pelé is down to his shorts before being hoisted aloft by fans and paraded around the stadium.
The Brazil team of 1970 was undoubtedly one of the greatest of all, setting a benchmark that has haunted subsequent Seleção sides for generations. And while the whole squad was fantastic, Pelé will always be remembered as the focal point. His four goals, including one in the final, helped push Brazil to victory, just like his goals had 12 years earlier in Sweden. And they were great goals, especially his first against Czechoslovakia.
But Pelé was such an outstanding player that it is more than just his goals that are remembered from 1970. Only Pelé would have the audacity to try to lob the goalkeeper from his own half. Only Pelé would have the nerve to dummy an onrushing ‘keeper and then retrieve the ball and almost score. Only Pelé could power a header so hard and so perfectly into the bottom corner that the resulting save would be described as the greatest save of all time. And only Pelé could finish off the greatest World Cup final team goal with a no-look pass to a colleague.
Pelé was an outstanding goalscorer but also, unlike many other greats in front of goal, so much more. It really wasn’t just about what he did that made him great; it is also the time and place that he did it. That’s what gets results.

I once wrote that before a nation or league attempts to “produce” its own Lionel Messi, it would be well-served to produce the next James Milner. On the surface, such a statement reads like a joke laden in sarcasm. Some might say it’s bordering on mockery. But one must be cautious to assume a player like James Milner is not as valuable or less important on the football pitch than the stars and playmakers that garner the attention. That would be a massive misstep in judgment. In essence, it would put the joke back on you.
As Milner enters preseason number 20, it’s no secret that his professionalism, fitness, versatility and threshold for physical output is still off the charts. As Liverpool’s players who were not off on international duty report back for pre-season fitness testing, there’s a general acceptance about who dominates each gruelling running-based assessment like the lactate threshold run – which measures a player’s aerobic endurance – or the insufferable bleep test.
Milner is not only able to push the pace of these efforts, he does it consistently year after year. While not effortless by any stretch, his training ground footage shows a steely look of determination as he leans into the fitness tests, dropping several players all of whom are younger as he finds yet another gear to push the upper limits of his output.
When he debuted for Leeds at the age of 16, it was obvious that there was something different about such a talent as he became mainstay in the line-up in his initial seasons. Over the years, the volume and level of play ramped up as Milner turned out for Newcastle, Aston Villa a dominant Manchester City and, at present, a high-octane Liverpool. It is due to his versatility, discipline and reliability and willingness to play any position when called upon that has well-served two of English football’s powerhouse clubs in recent years.
So what is it about Milner’s longevity that few players reach well into their mid-30s playing at the highest level of club football?
Examining the state of the modern game, it is clear that football and its cast of characters understand that the game is in a constant state of change. In many ways, modern football is as formulaic as it has ever been with sequences and patterns of play drilled into the minds and muscles of the top players from the youngest ages. Additionally, tactical deployments and variations are part of the modern player’s footballing DNA that account for permutations of an amorphous playing philosophy.
As the game continues to flourish and skill, creativity and ingenuity remain invaluable to the beauty and spectacle of football, there exists a conundrum of development. Young players, more than any previous era, have access to professional-grade coaches from early ages.
It has been argued that while this is great from an organisational standpoint, it all comes at the cost of creativity. Often the result is a team of well-trained, extremely athletic role players that don’t necessarily have the creativity or panache that is so undefined yet coveted in the modern game. This begs the question: “what is creativity on the football pitch?”
The answers are undefined as well. The subjectivity of the concept makes it so. Creativity, like the game itself, is in a constant state of flux. In other words, creativity in regards to modern football is often siloed into what is deemed entertaining and effective. The problem is entertainment and effectiveness don’t intersect as much as people think. For the modern player, there is a state of uncertainty about what should be done during a game. And so the quandary persists about developing players who are essentially hard-working robots.
James Milner is not a robot, but make no mistake, he is a machine. To do what he’s accomplished in the game requires the ability to play in systems with teammates that fit the creative mould. He’s been able to play at the highest level in different eras for two decades. He’s played for coaches that all have different philosophies and demands that highlights not only his versatility, but his durability and ingenuity as a player and as a professional. There are creative players who could never have such longevity. It is no accident that Milner has amassed nearly 800 appearances in club football and been capped for his country 61 times.
From the tactics on display, the demands of each player, the systems, skill level, athleticism and intelligence – the game has evolved. As such, the roles and responsibilities of a player now blend together more than ever. For example, a full-back is expected to attack as much as defend, a target striker is now commonly seen dropping deep into the midfield to collect the ball off the backline, goalkeepers are proxy playmakers with the ball at their feet. If it is liquid football we crave, the game has truly become as fluid as ever.
However, as the footballing world rapidly accelerates to new levels of performance, there remains the need for a true constant on a pitch full of variables – the utility player. Of course, these players garner many labels: the workhorse, the machine, a unit, the terrier, the destroyer, the jack of all trades. It should be evident that a player cast in this mould or quarried from mines of football’s unglamorous doldrums is what makes the fleet-footed, supremely skilled stars of the game shine brighter.
And that just highlights the physical attributes of such a player. When one factors in the mental strength and maturity of such a player and the ripple effect they have on a team in an era where promising players are exposed to the highest levels of the professional game – and all that comes with that privilege and responsibility on and off the pitch – ‘the leadership quotient’ should have a metric associated with positive examples a seasoned pro can have on a team dynamic.
There is an art and science in being so versatile, robust, fit, intelligent; such a plug-and-play asset to any football team is almost impossible to measure. The argument could be made that the player fitting the James Milner mould is at least if not more valuable than the hot and cold mercurial talent of a star striker or flashy winger.
Yes, the flash and allure of the super-skilled player is important and more often than not it is their skill that tips the scales of a match in their teams favour, but there’s a catch. When they’re hot, they’re untouchable, unplayable. When they’re cold, however, well that’s when the questions come of form, durability, morale, and versatility.
And so we should celebrate the Milner’s of the world. Not only can these players “do it on a cold rainy night in Stoke” – that’s where they may be most comfortable. And players of this ilk do it week-in and week-out, not for years, but for decades. What makes Milner’s contributions so valuable is that his assets as a player serve his team and his managers well before they serve him. And he’s been able to do this for two decades at the highest levels.
Several years ago, a video floated around social media of Milner out on the Etihad pitch with Manchester City’s kit man lashing accurate cross-field balls into the ball bag. There are also clips of Milner literally making tackles on the ground with his face in desperation to give it all for his team and cause. He’s robust in the tackle, he tracks relentlessly, his work off the ball makes the job of his teammates easier, and his contributions during the run of play are often not captured by the camera or discussed nearly enough.
From upending Neymar in a Champions League match to executing a goal-line save at full stretch, to putting in a shift for 90 seconds or 90 minutes – this is what football is about just as much as flash players we all love.
Football’s folklore champions its stars – and rightfully so. The sport has a way of elevating figures who represent all that is attractive in being a professional player. The stardom, the glitz and glamour, the illustrious sponsors and, most prominently, the privilege of being considered invaluable to the cause. The modern game’s inflation of salaries, transfer fees and, undoubtedly, the egos of footballers, ensures that people tend to overlook the value of the utility player.
Think of football as a party. “You never regret leaving a party early but you often regret staying too late.” Milner, much like other stalwarts in the game, takes nothing for granted. They treat their preparation, diet, fitness and study of the opposition and various systems that they may be tasked with dealing with each week seriously.
Of course, there are outliers of the game that are doing the business well into their thirties like Cristiano Ronaldo, Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi, to name a few. These players still turn out for upwards of 50 matches a year (not including international duty) and all of whom are still so talented and dominant that they can afford to lose a step or two and they’re still levels ahead of everyone else it seems.
Although Milner is one of the most recognisable and prominent utility men in English and possibly world football, there are others who have played this role and seemingly found the mysterious fountain of youth well into the twilight of their careers. Players like Milner can spark an interesting debate when it comes to a footballer’s development.
Is it better to be a standout specialist or a versatile player who is system-agnostic meaning the method or format of the tactic system is less important to their function within that system? When the need arises to fill in a position, adjust to an opponent’s tactic, to be the bridge between order and chaos, the utility player is the plug-and-play solution in the most literal sense.
Perhaps what makes football’s utility players so special is less about their triage work on the pitch when called upon, but what we don’t see that occurs on the training pitch and away from the floodlights of the stadium pitch. Anyone who’s been around or studied the professional game and observed how players look after themselves knows that a player’s success and longevity is borderline circumstantial and alchemy as they aim to delay Father Time’s heavy-handed and inevitable signs that the show is nearly over.
The consummate professionals are the players who may turn out ten minutes or play the full 90 minutes on matchday, and regardless of their performance, stay to do mobility work, more conditioning, and even speciality work. These players seldom make the headlines and hardly receive the win bonus or bag any individual accolades.
What they do accomplish, however, is a dialled-in approach to their nutrition, physical and mental conditioning, study of the game, relationship with their manager and team’s needs, and ability to constantly evolve their playing style to continue to be an asset on the pitch.
Those involved in football development also know that for every one diamond, you’ll find a thousand pieces of crushed coal. That’s a sobering thought and opens up another door in the inexact science that is player development – why is it that all anyone wants to produce is a diamond when it may be more beneficial to be the fuel that perhaps does not burn the brightest or as quickly as everyone else, but it burns efficiently when season after season.
Another aspect of the game the utility man has figured out is the Law of Accommodation, which suggests that one must vary the pace, volume and velocity of their exertion lest they plateau and regress. Football’s utility players understand this law and they earn their livelihood by living in this arena. No matter what team they’re on or who the manager is, they do more than just plod along and do their jobs – they evolve with the game while serving as the constant in football’s equation on matchday.
As observers, we are often caught in two minds when thinking about football and the traits necessary to succeed at the game at every level. The path to mastery starts in the general, with a broad skill range and scope of play and inevitably sharpens as the game and skill level and competition advances. By the time players achieve whatever their ceiling in the game is, the game is defined by two types of players: specialists and taskers.
There can be no argument that people love nothing more than seeing a specialist ply their trade and work at their craft – often at the expense of the taskers. That’s entertainment. That’s what they’re paid to do and that’s what the vociferous crowd yearns to see. But what of the other players, the swiss army knife-types that seem to do it all – just not glamorously. Players like Milner truly are jacks of all trades, masters of … well, all of them? Let’s pump the brakes for a moment.
Modern football has afforded us a track record of where the game has been and provided a glimpse as to where it might be heading. We spoiled by the true specialists in the game and player development, especially at the elite levels, aims to produce 11 specialists on the field that come together to form a cohesive unit in a team sense that allows individuals to showcase their skill-sets while performing as an organism hell-bent on winning while playing to a philosophy and system of play.
The problem, however, is the marathon men and grinders, have become truly underappreciated. Look, some players play the piano and others carry the piano. This is the nature of football. This is the reality of professional levels of anything. All the great teams and players must have a supporting cast. Without the supporting cast, the specialists can’t go to work and be special.
Moreover, a specialist, through their football, lets the opponent show them the ways they want to be defeated on the day. But it’s the taskers, the players who are masters of consistency and adjustment that do all the intangibles that also make the game special.
If we’re not careful, the development spectrum will only try to produce players who are good at one or two aspects of play instead of well-rounded, durable, versatile players who make every team they play on better because well, they pull the sled. This presents the modern footballer with a Catch-22 regarding their outlook of skill acquisition: specialise and be irreplaceable or generalise and risk being overlooked.
The reality is football is organised at younger ages at the present. Young players often have coaches in their ear and diagramming every movement and pattern on the training pitch from the drills to the decision-making. This isn’t necessarily all bad, as the game at a high level requires organisational excellence and the ability to play multiple roles. A Milner or N’golo Kanté or any other terrier on the pitch is not going to be a showstopper in ways that Messi or Ronaldo are – never in a million years.
Make no mistake, the two player types are not the same. But would those stars be as impactful without the players who slot in and out different line-ups based on formation, opponent, day of the week, need for the team, and any other extraneous situation demanding their graft and grind? In a word, no.
Players with golden boots require players with blue collars to help. The oft-used motivational quip, “You don’t rise to the occasion, you fall to the level of your training” comes to mind when we look at the way Milner prepares for yet another season. The quote itself is poetic and just and it originates from the Greek lyrical poet, Archilochus, who is credited with being among the earliest Greek writers who were masters of communication, were also exceptional soldiers who knew what it meant to literally go to war.
And so, as James Milner enters his 20th year as a professional he may be simple, but he was never, ever boring.

Why Adam Lallana deserves your attention

Why Adam Lallana deserves your attention

Adam Lallana is one of those players who has always been there. There, hanging in the space between irrelevant and popular. A decent, gifted squad player who can be relied on, but nowhere near a world-beater and not often a game-changer.
It was in the 55th minute of Liverpool’s clash with Leicester City that Lallana announced that he was no longer there, but in fact here. Of course, Liverpool fans would have known that this day would eventually arrive, but for the neutral, goals, glitz, skill and the occasional overdose of passion in a screaming, Diego Costa-style meltdown, are more noticeable than being consistently solid.
The 55th-minute strike for Lallana was born of thunder and struck so hard into the roof of the net that Thor himself would likely be stroking the legendary Mjolnir in a jealous manner upstairs in Asgard. Danny Drinkwater and Christian Fuchs (who wisely chose to move out of the way) couldn’t do a thing to stop Lallana, who gave the surging Sadio Mané the simplest of options with a lay-off on the edge of the box.
It’s what happens moments before Adam’s goal that impresses the most, though. As Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge receives the ball, Lallana is already racing forward between the defenders offering an option. The ball is passed to Wijnaldum instead, who is quickly closed down and can only feed it to the waiting Lallana. The intelligence displayed from him in playing situations is usually reserved for those who are looking towards the end of their career, not the peak of it; those who have hundreds of senior games under their belt. He’s always trying to make something happen so that the game can be won and you will rarely catch him needlessly waiting for the ball to roll to his feet.
There’s the intelligence, but there’s also an abundance of desire within Lallana. The midfielder covered over 13 kilometres during the Leicester game. A match which must have seemed as though it was a hall of mirrors to Ranieri’s men, with Lallana popping up all over the place. A player with this much ability combined with that much stamina can be world class when a streak of good form comes along.
It’s quite some fortune, then, that Lallana is English an,d along with Ross Barkley and Raheem Sterling, will be able to provide the England team with flair and style for a good number of years. He’s a mixture of Gareth Barry, Steven Gerrard and current team-mate James Milner, but gifted with a technical ability so refined and feet so swift, you could easily picture him in La Liga. Drive, resilience, stamina, striking ability and intelligence are quickly defining the 2016-17 Adam Lallana who is rapidly showcasing exactly why Liverpool paid £25 million to prise him away from Southampton a few seasons ago.



Southampton are a club who seem to be consistently churning out quality players, from Gareth Bale and Theo Walcott, to Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Calum Chambers and of course Lallana. Following his development at the south coast club, former Southampton manager Nigel Adkins relied on Lallana for the two successive promotion campaigns that saw the Saints leap from League One of the English Football League straight to the Premier League.
I should have penned this article a while ago. I’ve always been fond of Adam Lallana, but after scoring nine goals for Mauricio Pochettino’s overachieving Saints in 2013-14 and earning that expensive transfer up north to Merseyside, he fell off my map. It’s not that he wasn’t doing good or working his usual magic, but he’d made the ‘mistake’ of becoming a quietly consistent player. Always there, around, but never the focus. It’s only just that the former Saint is thriving under Liverpool’s Teutonic manager, but Jürgen Klopp will have that effect on you.
Lallana displayed his numerous qualities on the international scene during Sam Allardyce’s first game in charge of England against Slovakia. It was another game in which he had covered a generous amount of turf and attempted to orchestrate the attacking play of his team. After luck had defied him on a number of occasions, it took until the 94th minute for Lallana to stroke the winner past an exasperated Slovakian keeper. It was another game in which there had been bigger names on display, but Lallana had managed to outshine them all. Confidence and poise are another part of the package that Lallana brings to Liverpool.
After just four games of the 2016-17 Premier League season, Lallana has scored twice – meaning he’s already halfway towards meeting last season’s return of four goals in 30 league appearances. For many that thought Lallana was missing an end product to his play, this shows an early inclination that he is becoming a complete player, one who could feature in any team in the league.
Adam Lallana might not end the season as the Premier League’s best player, nor is he likely to make the team of the year. He might not even score many goals or provide loads of assists come May. Whether Lallana stays on top of the Premier League pile is neither here nor there, but right now, he’s the player most deserving of your attention.

James Milner: the underappreciated enigma of English football

James Milner: the underappreciated enigma of English football

‘Boring James Milner’: as nicknames go, it’s not the worst dished out in England over the last few decades. He could have been called Shrek, or likened to a vegetable.
His style of play does leave a little to be desired, however. He might be fond of the occasional step-over at the Camp Nou, but he’s best known for being a workmanlike player who’s never more than satisfactory despite being an important component in the team. Solid but uninspiring: that seems to be the popular opinion. It’s a long way from a talent described as “the future” by Fabio Capello in 2008.
He’s teetotal, which probably feeds into his boring persona. You won’t find him spilling out of any clubs in the middle of the night, but on the pitch it’s sometimes hard to tell if he’s doing a good job or not. This is a player with more titles than Steven Gerrard and more England caps than Paul Gascoigne and Theo Walcott. He may not catch the eye but he’s a dependable asset for any club lucky enough to have him.
While he can play in a number of positions across the park, in many ways his versatility has counted against him over the years. The ability to slot in almost anywhere meant it was easy for managers to find a place for him within the squad, but it also meant it was easier to shunt him out wide.
He’ll be the first to admit that he’s not one to complain, preferring to focus on whatever was best for the team at the time. It’s another reason why he’s struggled for playing time, as it’s easier to leave out a player who won’t come barging into the manager’s office.
A lack of showboating on the field belies the fact that he’s effective, focusing on keeping it simple. On the other hand, it’s strange to think that he was tipped to be one of the biggest attacking stars as a youth.
After exploding onto the scene as the youngest scorer in the Premier League for Leeds United, it seemed like the only way was up. Milner had already made waves at the club before his goal, although he had to move on as the Whites fell victim to the financial cost of failing to qualify for the Champions League.

Milner proved his worth as a central midfielder at Aston Villa
• • • •
He made his debut at 16, becoming the second-youngest player to feature in the Premier League for his hometown club. He was sold to Newcastle where he spent four seasons at St James’ Park before moving on to Villa Park.
He finally got to play in central midfield after the club sold Gareth Barry to Manchester City in 2009, but it was short-lived as he decided to join Barry in helping the Citizens achieve their dream of becoming a real force in English football.
Manchester City reportedly paid £26 million for Milner in a deal that saw Stephen Ireland going the other way in 2010, and the player managed to become a mainstay in the squad at the expense of his preferred position.
He was shunted out wide and picked ahead of Jesús Navas, playing a vital part as the team continued to develop into one of England’s elite. He picked up two league titles during his time at City, offering balance on the flank thanks to his positioning and ability to read the game.
Roberto Mancini had a strong relationship with Milner, though after he left the club it looked like it could be over for the midfielder. When Manuel Pellegrini took the helm in 2013, appearances slowly became sparser, and it was drawing ever closer to a crucial time in his career. The manager, however, had nothing but praise for a player that he often left out at the expense of more temperamental stars:
“I’m Milner’s number one fan. Find me a more complete English player. There are players who’re better technically, yes. Quicker players, yes. Players who head better, yes. But show me one who does all the things Milner does well. There isn’t one.
“It’s hard to leave him out. Respect, commitment and performance level: 10/10, fantastic. He’s polyfunctional: full-back – the only position he doesn’t like – attacking midfield, wide. I played him as a forward and the team averaged three goals a game. He gives everything.
“Milner’s a phenomenon, a guy with big balls and a heart this big, intelligent, great mentality, one of those players that when you leave him out you’re left with this feeling of injustice; it hurts because he should always play but sometimes you need a technical player with other characteristics. I hope he stays. If he doesn’t it will be because there’s an important offer.”



As it turns out, an important offer did come in. Leaving Manchester City wasn’t really a big risk but it gave the player the opportunity to prove that he could play in his preferred position in central midfield. In interviews afterwards he spoke about not wanting to have any regrets, even though he could have added to his trophy tally if he stayed in Manchester – something the club themselves wanted.
Liverpool is where he’s currently playing but fans were divided when it came to judging the signing on the whole. He doesn’t get many goals, and mistakes will always be highlighted when you don’t have the flicks and tricks to wow the crowds and armchair pundits.
Milner recently confirmed that he would be quitting the England team, with the caveat that he would still drop in to help if Sam Allardyce called for aid. Once again, he’s doing what’s best for the team, and it allows space in the squad for a younger member.
Given that he played just three minutes of the Euro 2016 tournament, you can see why he’s given up. He failed to feature in many international tournament games; it’s a shame considering he usually performs at a dependable level – something many England players struggle to do at big tournaments.
Essentially, a lack of pace is probably the key characteristic that holds him back from being held in higher regard. He makes up for it by being pretty good at everything else, and it should allow him to continue playing at a high level in later years.
He has one of the best engines in the Premier League and he still has a few years left on the clock. As for being boring, he’s actually pretty deadpan, and at least he gets the joke. That being said, he did attempt some sleuthing as he suspected somebody at the club was behind the account: “It’s good fun. I’ve read a few of them, and some of them are very funny. We went through this (at the club) wondering who it was. There were a few tweets about Asda so I was asking the masseurs where they shopped. I don’t think it’s anyone at the club. I’ve never got close enough, though. I thought I had but I realised they didn’t have enough banter. Who knows who it is? It’s good fun.”
Joining the Jürgen Klopp revolution at Liverpool (well, he actually signed for Brendan Rodgers but spent little time with the Northern Irishman) might not have earned him any trophies as of yet but he was one of the best performers in red last term, notching seven goals and 14 assists as the club fought for trophies on multiple fronts domestically and in Europe.

With a pass completion rate of over 81 percent in Europe, a solid defensive contribution throughout, and assists coming from a range of crosses and through balls, he proved his worth once again. And when you consider that he arrived on a free, it makes the deal just that little bit sweeter.
One of the best qualities a player can have is consistency. It separates amateurs from the experts, and Milner has it in spades. He’s far from average and testament to such a fact is that he’s missed by every team he’s graced over a career that has seen him play for some of the biggest clubs in the country.
It’s true that he might not have hit the heights that were expected when he picked up the first of his 61 England caps but there’s rarely been a bad word spoken about the player from his fellow professionals. Indeed, Dani Alves was full of praise for Milner when asked about his strongest opponents: “I have faced many [strong opponents] but the most annoying was James Milner. He follows you forward and follows you backwards. It’s very difficult because he attacks you and defends you, and then attacks you and defends you again.”
As a jack of all trades, Milner is probably one of the league’s best utility players. He did a job in nine different positions during one season at City – including as a false 9 – and it’s because of his sheer competence. There’s nothing yawn-inducing about his displays, and he has the intelligence to understand that positioning and a good pass will trump unnecessary flicks any day.
He had a difficult start at Liverpool but he managed to work his way into his new managers plans. He improved in the second half of the season as the Reds crashed out in multiple cup finals, and he still looks like he has a lot to give at Anfield.
He started off this year at left-back, impressing until injury forced him off during a pre-season friendly against Barcelona. Some fans even prefer him to Alberto Moreno in the position because he has the competence and all-round experience to edge the risky defender. That’s Milner in a nutshell. Better than players in their own position, even if he never seems to be able to hold down his own.
Considering the truism that most famous English stars are overrated, Milner is one of the few who flies under the radar with his no frills approach to the game. He takes care of himself and has immense pride in his role for the team. It’s the reason why he left Manchester City in the first place, and it’s why clubs like Arsenal and Liverpool were interested at the time.
If he’d been given more of an opportunity to play in central midfield who knows how it would have gone for him in the long-term? Either way, he can still be proud of a career spent in more positions than an adult film star.
So to the question as to why James Milner is considered a bit of an enigma after dividing so many; well, he quite simply shouldn’t be. There’s great value in being a dedicated, commitment and consistent professional. He may not ever receive the plaudits as he lack that wow factor but James Milner has been missed at the teams he left and praised by the most talented and experienced of individuals in the game. That speaks volumes.

Originally featured in the Barcelona magazine, if you like this you’ll love our work in print. Thick matte card, stunning photos, original art and the best writing around.
.
If Barcelona is a religion and the Camp Nou the holiest of reliquaries, then Lionel Messi, Luis Suárez and Neymar were the 21st-century apostles who disseminated the Blaugrana doctrine to the masses. For many of the most distinguished clubs around Europe and the world, their fortunes have been tied inextricably with a venerable triumvirate who would later pass into the realm of footballing myth.
For Manchester United, it was the holy trinity of Best, Law and Charlton; for Real Madrid, the serial Champions League winners, Bale, Benzema and Ronaldo. On the international stage, Brazil could boast Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho. And it didn’t always have to be forwards. Where else but in Italy would shrines be built to the art of defending? In Milan, the Rossoneri venerate Baresi, Costacurta and Maldini, while in Turin, the Juventus Stadium has become a monument to Bonucci, Barzagli and Chiellini.
But of all the clubs that straddle the pantheon of footballing greats, few can lay serious claim to having possessed not one but two wondrous attacking trinities. For, you see, as pious as they were prodigious, Messi, Suárez and Neymar are not unique in Barcelona’s storied history. They served at the altar to Pep Guardiola, but before them came the man who was the bedrock for this religion, the architect of this great cathedral to football, Johan Cruyff.
He who was resurrected in the cashmere roll-necks, meticulous ball retention and high pressing of his progeny, Guardiola. And, just as importantly, he who assembled the fabled “Dream Team”, which swept all before it on a bloody crusade upon domestic and European football between 1989 and 1994. At its head, for a little over one effulgent season, gleamed the trinity of Michael Laudrup, Hristo Stoichkov and Romário.
For those who witnessed the miracles they wrought in the fabled season of 1993/94, few would have thought it possible to repeat. However, rise once more did three faithful disciples of Cruyff’s time-honoured masterplan, as dangerous and captivating as their predecessors. And, like those who had preceded them, their collective genius was almost as fleeting. Yet, inevitably, though both would leave their own indelible marks on the fabric of Barcelona history, there will always remain the pressing question: of these hallowed trios, which was the greater?
It would be easy to assume that Messi, Suárez and Neymar were superior due to the sheer number of accolades bestowed upon them. In the three seasons they played together, they plundered 250 goals, registered 116 assists and won a staggering nine trophies, including the fabled treble of 2014/15. Statistics that almost defy belief. Statistics, however, that are not always indicative of the full picture – especially at a club like Barcelona, where style is almost as paramount as substance.

Read  |  Lionel Messi and the arrival of a great in the March 2007 El Clásico
After all, the rewards Messi and co. reaped came in a period when Barcelona were already at their most profitable. Incorporating those three into a Barcelona side that had won six of the last ten LaLiga titles, as well as three Champions Leagues in the same period, was like gilding a gold statue with, well, more gold. Barcelona were already the best team in the world. This was a side moulded by Guardiola, run by Xavi and Iniesta, marshalled by Puyol and inspired by Messi. It was positively quivering with talent.
On the other hand, the atmosphere that Romário, Stoichkov and Laudrup played through could not have been more different. As incomprehensible as it may seem to contemporary supporters, Barcelona at the end of the 1980s was a very different beast to the one that would host Messi, Suárez and Neymar in the post-Guardiola years. The Blaugrana had endured a prolonged fallow period that had seen them crowned LaLiga champions only twice since 1961. This was not a side accustomed to winning championships, either on a domestic or European front.
As much as they struggled to break the Real Madrid stranglehold on the league, Barcelona could at least appease themselves with their superior football. Throughout the 1980s, they were renowned for a brand of play that saw the likes of Diego Maradona and Bernd Schuster given the freedom to execute such audacious football as to occasionally border on the realm of temerity.
Yet, it wasn’t until Cruyff would make the transition from player to manager, by way of Ajax, in 1988 that Barcelona began to claim the silverware that their style merited. The long wait for LaLiga was over but confidence was fragile. Real had taken their eye off the league and let Barcelona in at the turn of the decade, but they were brooding in the background, a vengeful, bitter beast prowling at Catalan heels.
Amid dwindling attendances, Cruyff’s Dream Team reinvigorated the city, imparting on the hordes of Culés that would return to ascend the steps of Camp Nou each week memories of such thunderous jubilation as can only be found in football. And then came the miracle season of 1993/94, the glorious pinnacle that was achieved when the collective ingenuity of their impudent forward trident was realised.
Whereas a succession of Barcelona managers had built their sides around Messi in the years following Guardiola, Cruyff already had two-thirds of his attacking triumvirate in place by the time he added a certain Romário into the mix. In Stoichkov, the Dutch tactician had a footballer who lived and breathed Barcelona. In the same way that Carles Puyol was ingrained into the fabric of this football club, Stoichkov was Cruyff’s general on the pitch as much as he was off it. Indomitable, the Bulgarian forward was as talented with a football as he was demanding of his teammates.

Read  |  Hristo Stoichkov: the architect in Cruyff’s Barcelona
If Stoichkov was Cruyff’s general in attack then Laudrup was his artist. Of course, the maverick Dane enjoys something of a lukewarm reputation amongst the Blaugrana faithful, in no small part to his decision to trade the Catalan capital for the white of Madrid in 1995 following a – some would say inevitable – falling out with Cruyff. Some feat when you consider that, amongst those fortunate to have seen both play, Laudrup is considered by many to be inferior only to the great Lionel Messi in Barcelona’s long history of glittering talent. A man whose close control was tighter than Ronaldinho’s, whose passing range surpassed Xavi’s, and whose intelligence outshone Busquets’.
Into this mix of belligerence and beauty, Cruyff inserted the final piece of his jigsaw. His Dream Team had been taking shape in the years between 1989 to 1993, sweeping all before them on the domestic front, as well as claiming the 1989 Cup Winners’ Cup and the 1992 European Cup, as he had rebuilt Barcelona virtually from the ground up. And then, in 1993, Romário entered the picture.
The volatile Brazilian arrived in Catalonia having claimed 127 goals in 142 matches for PSV and immediately forged a prosperous partnership with Stoichkov. The pair enjoyed something of a telepathic relationship in which – in a rare case concerning two supremely self-confident footballers – they seemed to inspire each other to perform better. With Stoichkov and Romário often unmarkable, the ammunition was supplied by Laudrup. ‘Made in Laudrup’ became the expression, as his teammates would attest. “Just run. He will always find a way of passing you the ball,” said Romário.
Given the monumental impact of Laudrup, Stoichkov and Romário and the extraordinary success of Messi, Suárez and Neymar, it’s easy to begin drawing parallels between the two. Anyone who watched the latter perform together could not help but be mesmerised by the complexity, the dynamism and the effortlessness of the football they played. In the modern world, where 4-4-2 was slowly phased out and the rise of the number 10 led to the prominence of the 4-2-3-1 and then, in turn, the return of the versatile 4-3-3, Messi, Suárez and Neymar were about as perfect a front three as you could want to compile.
Suárez with his direct, endless running and his proclivity for harrying and harassing opposing centre-backs was a manager’s dream centre-forward. Not only could he supply the goals in and around the penalty box and weasel his way out of the tightest of spots, but he would run the doggies that so few strikers deigned to lower themselves to.
Neymar, on the left, was as precocious a talent as South America had produced in recent years. Lithe, agile and supremely skilful, he would beat defenders for fun, with an array of dizzying tricks and feints, but it was his blossoming ability to co-exist with his teammates, to provide the assists as well as the goals, that endeared him to Barcelona fans. For a footballer so self-invested as Neymar, his greatest triumph lay in fitting into the Barcelona game plan alongside Suárez and Messi.

Order  |  Barcelona
Of the latter, the final piece in this triumvirate, there remain no superlatives appropriate enough to describe his genius. No matter the language, the human collective, all 200,000 years of its developed knowledge, has simply run out of ways to adequately describe Lionel Messi. On their own, Suárez and Neymar were world-class; alongside Messi, they became greats. And it is eerie just how faithfully these 21st-century apostles mirrored the disciples that Cruyff assembled to disseminate the Barcelona scripture back in 1993.
In Laudrup, Barcelona had a player so intelligent, so sharp of mind as to see moments on the pitch unfolding even before they had happened. Like Messi, Laudrup was an artist and the turf of the Camp Nou was his canvas, upon which he would paint in such deft, beautiful strokes that his first touch belonged in the Casa Batlló rather than a football pitch. But that was only half of his game.
For all his artistic endeavour, Laudrup was equally renowned for his intense professionalism and dedication to football akin to the way a mathematician approaches an equation: analytical, focused, and efficient. “Had Michael been born in a poor ghetto in Brazil or Argentina with the ball being his only way out of poverty, he would today be recognised as the biggest genius of the game ever,” Cruyff said, referencing the one missing piece that Laudrup didn’t possess: bite.
Then there was Romário, a man for whom bite was no issue. Few Culés would argue against his reputation as the finest striker Barcelona ever possessed – greater even than Ronaldo. Like Suárez, he was a menace in the box – quick, determined and able to turn with alarming agility inside the penalty box in order to lose his marker. Whereas Suárez was prone to suffering through fallow patches, Romário genuinely scored in almost every game he played in.
As Guus Hiddink recalled of the Brazilian’s time in the Netherlands with PSV: “If he saw that I was a bit more nervous than usual ahead of a big game, he’d come to me and say: ‘Take it easy, coach, I’m going to score and we’re going to win’. What’s incredible is that eight out of the ten times he told me that, he really did score and we really did win.” Of the three forwards, Cruyff considered the Brazilian striker the most talented he had ever worked with. And few would argue with him on that.
Finally, the most temperamental of the three, there was Hristo Stoichkov. Like Neymar, he was never far from the limelight and often for the wrong reasons. However, where Neymar was rolling around on the pitch in fits of mock agony, Stoichkov was stamping on referees’ feet and earning himself the moniker ‘mal leche’ (bad milk). The Bulgarian was the bite Cruyff’s Barcelona sorely needed. He was erratic, sometimes inconsistent, often irascible, but above all, he was talented. So, so talented. As former Barcelona player Lobo Carrasco once put it: “He is the best forward in the world. He can run like Carl Lewis, play passes like Ronald Koeman, and finish every bit as well as, or better than, Gary Lineker.”

When in full flow, both sets of players were mystical, almost divine to watch, as though some higher power surely guided their movements, so instinctive and cohesive were they together on a pitch, yet therein lies something inexplicable about the way in which Laudrup, Stoichkov and Romário melded as if a single entity. Whereas Messi, Suárez and Neymar were part of a Barcelona team that oozed with depth, Laudrup, Stoichkov and Romário were the stars of a side that didn’t have the wealth of talent today’s Barcelonas can boast. They were the glittering jewels in Cruyff’s sceptre when he ascended to the pulpit of the Camp Nou.
One of the greatest endearing qualities Laudrup, Stoichkov and Romário possessed over their modern contemporaries was their ability to overcome hardship. Right from the off, it appeared as though the Bulgarian and the Brazilian were destined to clash. “Signing a fourth foreigner is plain stupid,” Stoichkov insisted, “but if the board think it is absolutely necessary, I would tell them to sign [Lubo] Penev. How much does Romário cost? 600m Pesetas? I’d take 200m from my own pocket and sign Penev.”
As for Romário, he was equally bellicose. Yet, though they appeared as abrasive as each other, the two became immediate friends. Stoichkov, ever the enforcer, ensured Romário turned up to training every day, while Romário, considered something of an introvert within the club, only ever spoke to the Bulgarian. Their children would attend the same school and their wives became best of friends. This staunch friendship translated to the pitch where the two roved in tandem along Barcelona’s front line, prowling the channels while Laudrup sought them out with inch-perfect passes. It was as much a conveyor belt as it was a work of art.
Though the two stars would overcome their rocky start, a greater obstacle loomed, one which would eventually tear the 1994 Barcelona side apart: the three-foreigner European rule. To modern football fans, it seems ludicrous and frankly antiquated that, 25 years ago, European competitions limited teams to fielding no more than three foreign players – and for Cruyff’s Dream Team, this posed a problem that the likes of Messi, Suárez and Neymar could never dream of confronting.
Cruyff was forced to drop one of his front three men throughout the 1993/94 season, partly owing to club captain Koeman’s imperious form at the heart of the Barcelona defence. One of the trio would inevitably give way, and this would cause friction. When left out, Stoichkov was described as being capable of fighting with his own shadow, while Romário would refuse to speak with anyone when it was his turn on the bench.
However, it was the dropping of Laudrup for the 4-0 mauling at the hands of AC Milan in the 1994 Champions League final that would prove the most costly omission of all. Barcelona were dismantled on the night, and it would serve as a metaphor of things to come; within six months, the club had been taken apart piece by piece as Cruyff, Stoichkov, Romário and Laudrup, the architects of once-in-a-generation football, all departed.

Read  |  Michael Laudrup and Preben Elkjær: a fantasy partnership devised in the heavens
Though they were part of a cohesive unit, both within their personal trinity and the team as whole, there always remained the notion that each of the three considered themselves the most important. In fact, Romário, when asked who he considered the five greatest footballers of all time, place himself fourth on his list. Tellingly, it was one place ahead of his contemporary, Stoichkov.
It was this individual insistence that the team was there only to serve them that would later bring about the dissolution of Messi, Suárez and Neymar, too. Neymar, long touted as the heir to Pelé, proselytised by the likes of Ronaldinho himself, was expecting to grow into Barcelona’s leading star as the magic of Messi waned. Instead, Messi, in another hallmark of his genius, merely adapted his game and once more rose to another level of brilliance that was simply unreachable by mere mortals. It was as if Messi ascended into godhood, a Catalan deification – and with it, Neymar’s patience finally snapped. Just like Romário, his productivity dropped and Real Madrid stole in to claim LaLiga.
Yet, it is symbolic of why Messi, Suárez and Neymar were always destined to succeed and why they never quite tugged at the heartstrings the same way Stoichkov, Romário and Laudrup did when you consider that, when Neymar departed, Barcelona resumed normal service and recaptured the title with Messi resplendent once more.
When Laudrup left in 1995 to join Real Madrid, he set in motion a series of events that would devastate Barcelona and leave them without silverware for three seasons. Perhaps, then, it is through the misty lens of time that Barcelona supporters around Catalonia, Spain and indeed the world view the hallowed trio of Laudrup, Stoichov and Romário as the greater. Or, perhaps, there was just something more exciting about them.
They wowed Barcelona fans when they were just getting used to winning trophies again. This was an era when Stoichkov was stamping on referees, Romário was punching Argentines, and Laudrup, despite being the best European footballer on the face of the planet, was being cruelly robbed of the Ballon d’Or year after year.
This was not the sanitised era of the unstoppable Barcelona juggernaut where trophies were expected and Messi, should he fancy it, could annihilate a team on his own with as much apparent effort as doing a few keepy-uppies in his back garden with his dog. Simply put, when it comes down to it, on a pure statistical level, there is no contest: Messi, Suárez and Neymar far outscored Laudrup, Stoichkov and Romário and collected more than thrice the number of trophies.
Yet, it’s perhaps the finest indictor of how intensely the Blaugrana congregation revere Romário, Stoichkov and Laudrup that virtually all of them would include those three in their top ten Barcelona players of all-time. They are no longer disciples; they have been canonised as saints. Of Messi, Suárez and Neymar, despite the records they shattered and the obstacles they toppled, especially in that momentous treble season of 2014/15, only Messi would be guaranteed to make the same list. The only consolation is that he’d be right at the very top.

Ronald Koeman could hardly believe what Johan Cruyff had decided. “Boss,” he said. “This is the first time and also the last time.”
The Dream Team was winding towards the end of its cycle, but it remained a force to be reckoned with; a juggernaut capable of blowing its competitors away. Michael Laudrup’s elegance, coupled with the enigmatic brilliance of Hristo Stoichkov, had sculpted Barcelona into a ruthless attacking machine with the 1993/94 season approaching. At the other end of the pitch, Netherlands international Koeman boasted an uncompromisingly confident swagger, marshalling the back-line and progressing play from deep.
Cruyff was obsessed with winning and he had found what was considered a near-perfect formula. On the back of five seasons decorated with silverware – three LaLiga titles, one European Cup, two Supercopa de España crowns, a Copa del Rey, the UEFA Super Cup, and the Cup Winners’ Cup – few could argue against his tactical nous and ability to make big decisions.
However, in his quest to ascertain the truly perfect marriage between his personnel and his Total Football approach, he signed Romário, the eccentric Brazilian striker who had been in prolific form for PSV Eindhoven. Four players from abroad were now on Barcelona’s books and, as a consequence of the three-foreigner rule, one would succumb to a place on the sidelines each game.
The wonderfully gifted Laudrup was generally the player who felt the brunt of Romário’s arrival, with Cruyff often favouring the blossoming partnership and friendship of Stoichkov and the Brazil star. Koeman was a mainstay in the starting line-up but when his manager sprung a surprise and dropped him for the opening game of the LaLiga season against Real Sociedad, instead plumping for Barcelona’s newest recruit in a bold, attacking setup, he did not hesitate to inform his coach that benching him regularly was simply not an option.
The Dutchman carried himself with professionalism. Softly spoken but firm and assertive, he led by example at Camp Nou. Koeman conveyed his self-belief on the pitch in a classy, unperturbed style and hardly minced his words when he felt an injustice had been done. Barcelona eased to a 3–0 win over Sociedad courtesy of a hat-trick from Romário, vindicating Cruyff’s choice to exclude the central defender and accommodate the exciting new arrival. However, it would prove to be an exception, rather than the rule, as the iconic manager proceeded to think twice about overlooking his compatriot again in the future.
Koeman’s confidence – almost a quiet arrogance – could have rubbed many up the wrong way. Cruyff, though a divisive figure at times during his managerial stint in Catalonia, perfectly understood the mentality of his central defender, whose faultless decision-making and breathtaking technique earned him a place in Barcelona folklore. He was a unique talent, and after the disappointment of being benched at the beginning of the 1993/94 season, he went on to write his name into European football history books.

Read  |  The genius of Ronald Koeman, the man who scored 239 goals from defence
First and foremost, Koeman was a brilliant defender. His reading of the game was second to none and his ability to anticipate play while acting decisively was valued enormously by Cruyff. It is seldom the case, however, that a centre-back is renowned for their exploits in the final third rather than in their own half. The Dutchman did things differently.
Koeman’s lowest goalscoring tally in a top-flight season was six, a return that would have been impressive for most defenders. These efforts came during the 1982/83 campaign at Groningen, where he emerged from the club’s academy as a 17-year-old. During his formative years, it became apparent that he would not develop into the quintessential central defender of his time, but instead, an idiosyncratic talent destined for the very top.
Indeed, it was at the summit where Koeman found himself, and in the 1993/94 campaign, he displayed a remarkable efficiency in front of goal on the biggest stage of them all. Barcelona didn’t reclaim the Champions League trophy after their triumph, courtesy of Koeman, in 1991/92 as they fell dramatically short at the final hurdle, but the defender still made history as he embarked upon an unprecedented goalscoring run, bettering almost every other player’s total in the tournament with his eight strikes from 12 games.
Koeman had already enjoyed the taste of success and went out in pursuit of his third European Cup. He scored a penalty for PSV during their shootout win in the final against Benfica in 1988 under Guus Hiddink, clinching his first title in the competition. What preceded the glorious evening in Stuttgart was an excellent individual campaign for Koeman, who netted 22 goals for the Eredivisie giants.
Signed by Cruyff in 1989 to operate as a sweeper in the heart of his defensive unit, he played a pivotal part in helping Barcelona secure their status as European champions in 1992. The final was tense and Sampdoria held their Spanish counterparts to a 0–0 draw as extra-time beckoned.
The Catalans were in need of inspiration as the clock ticked down towards what seemed to be the inevitable conclusion of a penalty shootout. When a free-kick was awarded with eight minutes of the 120 left to play, though, all eyes rested on Koeman, who delivered a piledriver that sent Wembley into raptures, clinching the trophy for his men with one of the competition’s most iconic goals.
Peculiarly, the strike against Sampdoria in 1992 was the Dutchman’s one and only throughout Barcelona’s victorious European campaign. Still, he found the back of the net 16 times in LaLiga, again displaying his magnificent form in the final third. More remarkably, however, he was not the highest-scoring defender in Spain – Fernando Hierro netted 21 times for Real Madrid – and came fourth in the race for the Pichichi, with Atlético Madrid striker Manolo scooping the accolade with 27 goals to his name.
Bitter disappointment then followed. Barcelona’s attempt to retain their solitary crown in 1992/93 was feeble at best, as they crashed out in the second round of the tournament at the hands of CSKA Moscow. However, inspired by the relentless consistency of imperious showings from Koeman, as well as Stoichkov and Laudrup’s form in front of goal, Cruyff’s men looked all but set to launch an assault on their European rivals once again, with the team full of confidence and their talismanic central defender at the peak of his powers.

Read  |  Hristo Stoichkov: the architect in Cruyff’s Barcelona
The new season brought about fresh optimism – the exciting arrival of Romário heightened expectations, too – but the experienced head of Koeman was at the forefront of everything Barcelona did well. The first test was presented by Dynamo Kyiv, who threatened to spoil any hopes of European glory in the opening round of the competition.
Cruyff and his men underwhelmed in Ukraine as their opponents drew first blood. Barcelona succumbed to a 3–1 defeat despite playing against ten men for longer than two-thirds of the match, a penalty from Koeman after half an hour unable to prevent the hosts from bouncing back and turning in a commendable performance. The second leg at the Camp Nou required a fightback, and for some time, the club’s place in the second round hung in the balance.
Laudrup opened the scoring before José Mari Bakero scored a brace. Serhiy Rebrov had netted a first-half goal, though, meaning that the two sides had cancelled each other out, with a 4–4 result on aggregate leaving the final stages of the affair finely poised.
As they did in 1992 during difficult moments, however, Barcelona looked towards Koeman for a source of magic – and he duly delivered a killer blow to the Ukrainian side. From 20 yards out, the defender swept a free-kick with exquisite accuracy into the bottom corner past Igor Kutepov, deceived by the effort aimed towards his starting position and into the net: 5–4 and Barcelona were through – albeit by the skin of their teeth.
The second round pitted them against Austria Wien, and they were again convincing on home soil. Barcelona eased to a 3-0 win at the Camp Nou in the first leg courtesy of another two goals from Koeman, who took his tally in the competition to four after three games. Cruyff later took his team to Vienna and they turned in a composed performance, winning 2–1 in the second leg after a brace from Stoichkov booked their place in the groups.
Barcelona were the favourites to progress from the next stage of the tournament, in which they would encounter Galatasaray, Monaco and Spartak Moscow, but challenging tasks still awaited them. In their first outing, the Spanish outfit travelled to Turkey and were left frustrated, with Galatasaray holding them to a stalemate. The team then locked horns with Monaco and eased the nerves somewhat with an assured performance in a 2–0 victory courtesy of a brace from Txiki Begiristain.
Soon after, Barça arrived in Moscow, perhaps with their failings against CSKA from the previous season in the back of their minds, to face Spartak, but could only manage a 2–2 draw as Romário and Laudrup’s strikes were rendered insufficient. Koeman hadn’t found the back of the net in a little while by his own elevated standards – he would only fail to score in six of Barcelona’s 12 European fixtures during this season – but did turn in some resolute defensive showings along the way.
Cruyff had hitherto overseen a satisfactory if unspectacular group-stage campaign, with five points amassed from a possible nine. What followed, however, was an exhibition of the stylish, classy Dream Team that had been embossed upon European football by the Dutchman, as Barcelona dismantled Spartak at home, with Koeman emerging as the lynchpin.

Read  |  The battle of Barcelona’s trinities: Stoichkov-Laudrup-Romário or Messi-Neymar-Suárez?
Valeri Karpin put the visitors one up after just three minutes and the fervorous atmosphere within the Camp Nou grew expectant. Stoichkov’s equaliser heading into half time gently eased the disconcertment, but nothing less than a win would have been acceptable. Until the 75th minute, Barcelona stood at level pegging with their Russian opponents. By the full-time whistle, they had obliterated them 5–1 as a consequence of a majestic attacking performance in the final quarter of an hour.
Guillermo Amor put the hosts ahead for the first time in the match before Koeman consolidated the win in emphatic fashion – not once, but twice from free-kicks. As he and Stoichkov loomed over the ball, 30 yards from goal, it was apparent that the Dutchman would be the man to probe Gintaras Staučė’s goal. Barcelona fans had only just regained composure following the delight of Amor’s crucial strike, but they were soon off their feet and breathless once again as Koeman leathered home one of the competition’s most memorable set-pieces.
Stoichkov dummied, running over the ball towards the box before his teammate unleashed a rippling strike. The ball curved around the Spartak wall, leaving them rooted to the spot, and into the top left corner of the goal. Before Staučė had even landed on the floor following a hapless attempt to thwart Koeman, the defender was wheeling away in celebration. He sprinted towards the Camp Nou faithful, arms out wide and a smile etched across his face before sliding on the hallowed turf, his teammates racing to shower him with adulation.
While the 80,000 watching on joined the team in displaying their appreciation for Koeman, Cruyff was emotionless. The manager sat on the bench, stern-faced, and cut a relaxed figure amidst the eruption inside the stadium. His defender’s genius never ceased to enthral the masses, but the boss had probably seen Koeman strike astonishing free-kicks into the top corners with inexplicable regularity on a daily basis in training. It was remarkable, without a doubt, but it was nothing new: Koeman made the extraordinary look easy.
His work wasn’t finished there, either. Just three minutes later, Stoichkov and Koeman again stood before a Spartak wall, this time stationed on the opposite side of the previous free-kick. Unsurprisingly, the Dutchman netted again, but after a more experimental approach to the set-piece on this occasion.
Koeman laid the ball off to Stoichkov before the favour was returned, stopped dead in its tracks by the Bulgarian, and powered an effort around the inside of the defenders – again stood still in awe of their counterpart’s devastating technique – towards the bottom corner of Staučė’s goal. Different style, same outcome: Koeman had scored his fourth free-kick and sixth goal of the tournament before the group stages had even concluded.
Barcelona still had one more goal left in them and Romário was the man who capped an impressive win. The Brazilian’s slaloming run earned his side a penalty and appeared to present Koeman with a chance to score a hat-trick from the spot. It would have been the Dutchman’s second in Spain following his treble in a 7–2 win over Trabzonspor in 1990, most memorable for a frankly outrageous goal in which he lobbed the ball over five of the Turkish side’s defenders in a single action before beating the last man and delicately chipping the goalkeeper. Nevertheless, Cruyff had other ideas.

Order  |  Barcelona
Koeman played every single minute of Barcelona’s 1993/94 Champions League campaign apart from the final five minutes of their win over Spartak. Just as Romário geared up to take the penalty he had earned, Cruyff opted to take his central defender off. It was a bizarre decision, particularly with his player on the cusp of a hat-trick, but the standing ovation and outpouring of appreciation amongst the supporters made it worthwhile. Koeman gracefully exited the pitch, reciprocating the affection towards the club’s faithful, and watched Romário complete the rout from the unfamiliar location of the bench.
Barcelona had found their groove and they continued their fine form with a 3–0 demolition of Galatasaray. In a controlled display, Amor handed his side the lead after some excellent close control and vision from Begiristain. Shortly before, Koeman had tested Hayrettin Demirbaş with a free-kick from range, but the Turkish goalkeeper did well to scamper across and claw the strike away. He would not be able to deny the defender from 12 yards, though.
Referee Leslie Mottram pointed to the spot with little more than 20 minutes to play after Laudrup was felled in the box, and Koeman confidently lifted the ball to the right of Demirbaş, sending him the wrong way to make it 2–0. Once more, Barcelona required a cool head to settle proceedings, and their centre-back was on hand to produce. The team went on to win 3–0 after Eusebio Sacristán finished with a thunderous strike in the 77th minute.
The group-stage campaign culminated as Barcelona travelled to Monaco. Koeman didn’t get on the scoresheet in France, but he played his part in a staunch defensive showing from the visitors, who came away with a 1–0 win after Stoichkov netted in the 13th minute following a sumptuous lofted pass from Pep Guardiola. Cruyff’s men held firm for the subsequent 77 minutes and stoppage time, consummating an unbeaten six games.
Barcelona were one step from Athens, where Fabio Capello’s AC Milan would await after their 3–0 vanquishing of Monaco in the semi-finals. Standing between Cruyff’s side and another European final were Porto. The Portuguese outfit entered the clash on the back of a resilient 0–0 draw against Milan, but their efforts to resist the dynamic attacking orchestra that Cruyff had conducted were inefficacious.
Over 92,000 watched on in anticipation as Barcelona stood on the cusp of the most prestigious club game on the footballing calendar, and the hosts didn’t disappoint. They opened the scoring in impressive fashion as Stoichkov sprinted into the box and powerfully volleyed home a cross to put his side in front. Stoichkov, in merciless form, scored again in the 35th minute as Porto left him unattended at the back post, with the Bulgarian tapping home to make it 2–0.
Barcelona were in cruise control as they eased towards the final. Each player was composed, confident and took minimal risks in possession as the clock continued to tick and the curtains closed on Porto’s European campaign. Then, Koeman decided that something special – something unforgettable – would ensue before the fans.
Guardiola, with whom Koeman enjoyed an almost telepathic relationship – the pair regularly interchanging positions between the back-line and holding midfield – knocked the ball sideways into the Dutchman’s path in the centre circle. Porto’s players had been left exhausted, chasing shadows in a humbling affair made even more challenging by João Pinto’s dismissal after an hour. With 73 minutes on the clock, a vacant channel of space appeared. Koeman accepted the invitation to drive forward with the ball and powerfully advanced into the opposition half without any real pressure.

As the 30-year-old glided across the pitch with the ball at his feet, Porto didn’t press. After all, they were merely affording a central defender the opportunity to progress play, and with ten men in such testing circumstances, making calculated decisions off the ball was necessary. What the Portuguese outfit didn’t account for, and would soon regret, was that this wasn’t just any central defender. This was one who netted 19 goals during the course of the 1993/94 season, and his eighth and final strike of the European campaign was on its way in scarcely believable style.
Koeman ignored the safe options; he was never one to shy from taking a risk. Simple passes to his central midfielders presented themselves. In fact, an ambitious move would have been to thread the ball beyond Fernando Couto, away from the clutches of Jorge Costa, and to the feet of Stoichkov, who was chasing a hat-trick. To suggest that what the Dutchman instead opted to attempt was audacious would be an understatement of immense proportions. Koeman did something that would stagger even those who had grown accustomed to his exuberant style, which saw him plunder more goals than any other defender in European footballing history to date.
He let fly. The defender lashed the ball from the best part of 40 yards without even breaking stride. His right leg simply lunged in the recoil of the strike, with his left leg planted on the surface. It defied physics; a meteoric shot that soared high through the misty air trapped inside the cauldron of Camp Nou; a shot that would appear impossible without the generation of maximum, exhausting power and precision.
Koeman made it look utterly effortless, as he so often did. Porto heads swivelled as they could only gaze at the drive, which arrowed into the top corner of Vítor Baía’s net. The goalkeeper managed to get a hand to the effort, but his attempts were futile; two goalkeepers wouldn’t have stopped it.
Elated, Koeman wheeled away, conveying a familiar picture, with his arms outstretched as the Camp Nou rose to its feet for what felt like the thousandth time to lavish the Dutchman with applause. He’d not only put the icing on the cake with the last goal in a comprehensive 3–0 win, sending Barcelona to the Champions League final, but he had stolen the show with his eighth goal of the European campaign – an unprecedented feat for a defender and a tally that would not be bettered by any player in any position that season.
His thunderbolt from distance was a goal worthy of winning any match, and while it didn’t prove decisive in light of Stoichkov’s first-half brace, it was debatably the pick of any Barcelona scored during what was a memorable season for the club.
For all the wealth of attacking quality at Cruyff’s disposal, no-one scored goals quite like Koeman did. He was inimitable, a defender capable of shutting world-class forwards out, able to spray pinpoint passes from side to side, a willing runner with the ball at his feet, and a player blessed with a unique talent for striking from deep. The goal against Porto merely typified what he was all about: calm in bringing possession out from the back, intelligent in exploiting space, and emphatic in the final action. Koeman was sublime and his style perfectly fit the juxtaposition of elegance and intensity demanded by Cruyff.
The Dutchman’s exceptional individual campaign would, however, result in heartbreak at the final hurdle as a fairytale ending to the season eluded him and his teammates. Having been the hero two years before with his game-winning free-kick against Sampdoria, he was a part of the defensive unit that was this time dismantled by another Italian side – Capello’s Milan.

Read  |  MTV, Oscar Wilde and the implosion of Johan Cruyff’s Dream Team
On the back of securing a fourth successive LaLiga title – albeit on the final day of the season, as was also the case in the two prior seasons, with Barcelona pipping Deportivo to first place only owing to their superior goal difference – optimism heading into the final was understandable. However, Cruyff underestimated Milan. “Barcelona are favourites,” the manager insisted with misplaced conviction. “We’re more complete, competitive and experienced than at Wembley [two years before]. Milan are nothing out of this world. They base their game on defence; we base ours on attack.”
Cruyff’s words would come back to bite him, leaving more than just a mark as Capello’s men turned in a complete performance in Athens to humble the Dream Team with a 4–0 thrashing, crushing their hopes of lifting the trophy again. Barcelona failed to find their feet and turned in a showing devoid of the verve and creativity that their exploits over a number of seasons had promised. Daniele Massaro scored twice, while Dejan Savićević and Marcel Desailly also got in on the act as Milan celebrated winning the treble.
It was not the ending that Koeman’s campaign deserved, but it was one to remember for the 30-year-old, who sat at the very summit of the Champions League goalscoring charts alongside Wynton Rufer, the New Zealand international who excelled up front for Werder Bremen, with both players scoring eight apiece.
No defender had ever achieved such an accolade, with Koeman sweeping the top scorer award for his remarkable form in front of goal, which comprised three penalties, four free-kicks and one incredible effort from open play. He was his team’s chief source of inspiration throughout their route to Athens, and it was telling that he never dropped out of the starting line-up despite the pressure on Cruyff to somehow fit Laudrup, Stoichkov, and Romário into one team.
Koeman wouldn’t win another Champions League, but he departed Barcelona in 1995 a legend as he returned to the Netherlands to finish a professional career littered with honours and achievements at Feyenoord. He scored an astonishing 88 goals during his six-year tenure at Camp Nou and collected ten trophies along the way.
Having scored, on average, one goal in fewer than every three games throughout his playing career – Koeman netted 239 times in 685 club appearances – his goalscoring record is unmatched by any defender to have played in Europe. Of course, many of these strikes came from either the penalty spot or from free-kicks, but the Dutchman was a specialist.
He was, at one point in time, the best set-piece taker in football, and his technical quality aided him in achieving such a staggering return of goals across the marvellous career he enjoyed. The game may be changing, as it always will, but it seems impossible to envisage another defender netting quite as often, with the same efficiency and style, as he did.
Ronald Koeman was magnificent, a genuine joy to watch. There was little luck involved in his success, only pinpoint accuracy, unwavering confidence in his own ability and the technique to back it all up. He is one of football’s greatest ever defenders, and his incredible goalscoring run in 1993/94, including that goal against Porto, will forever be recalled as one of his greatest achievements.

Mohamed Salah: The Prince of Egypt
By Peter Staunton



























“Ramos is the public enemy!” thundered Al-Ahram newspaper on the front page of its early editions. The date read May 27, 2018.
                  
Egyptians had gone to bed the night before united in contemplation of the Champions League final’s enduring image. Mohamed Salah – tears forming in his eyes – was clutching his weakened left arm and walking out of
                  the biggest club game of his career.
                  
They were then waking up to an uncertain reality; their World Cup hopes looked like they’d just been ripped from the socket by Sergio Ramos’s heavy tangle with their own ‘Liverpool Knight’.
                  
“When he was injured, there was an atmosphere of sadness and worry among the fans,” Hamdi Nooh, Salah’s former coach at Al Mowakloon, now working as a consultant to the club president, tells Goal.
                  
There are two kinds of football fan in Egypt. One side has traditionally been driven by the domestic game where giants like Al-Ahly and Zamalek reign supreme. Their players – at home at least – are every bit as recognisable
                  as Salah and would be similarly descended upon if they ventured out into the streets.
                  
On the other side there is a generation of fans who admire the European game. Real Madrid, Barcelona, Manchester United and Chelsea have been the big teams for those Egyptian fans but Salah’s transfer to Liverpool has upended
                  that paradigm.
                  
Some older fans – who previously had no interest in the game overseas – are advising their Europhilic counterparts of the kick-off times of Liverpool matches. And that club have now taken the mantle of Egypt’s most
                  popular overseas team. Local broadcasts are making time for slots on Salah and the Reds.
                  
And that Sunday morning, Egypt’s front pages bellowed about a football match between an English team and a Spanish one in the capital of Ukraine. That is the Salah effect.
                  
Egypt have had great players before but they were local stars. They have supplied the odd major figure to the Arab region as a whole. But Salah is a star for these times, for the globe.
                  
He is showing Egyptians that – aside from competing for domestic supremacy – their players can be good enough to go and get the job done against the best in the world.
                  
He is a man who has revelled in the pressure that comes with being a team’s totem. He is a man that has brought Egypt back to the world stage and has his countrymen dreaming that one of their own might one day win the Ballon d’Or.

































It goes without saying that Salah is Egypt’s most important player; his goals against Congo in October earned them passage to the World Cup for the first time in 28 years. And in the immediate aftermath of that Champions League
                  injury, focus turned to Russia and what it would mean for the Pharaohs.
                  
However strong the affinity between Egyptians and Salah’s club, it is nothing compared to how they feel when he slips on the No. 10 shirt for his country. And with his World Cup participation in jeopardy, anger began to take hold.
                  
“Ramos assassinates Salah’s dream,” ran another Al-Ahram headline. There had of course been contact between the Real Madrid captain and Liverpool’s star forward. One came crashing down on the other and –
                  in a flash – both Liverpool and Egypt lost hope.
                  
“The People of Nagrig: We don’t forgive you Ramos,” roared the Al-Masaa newspaper. If Ramos was feeling the heat from Liverpool fans on the night it is small beer compared to the wrath of a nation of 95 million people.
                  
“Salah figured out how brutal some other players can be,” says Nooh. “I think he may have learned from this incident that there's other players who don’t share his style of play and are willing to hurt
                  other players.”
                  
There were lawsuits filed against the Spain defender for a billion dollars. The country scrabbled around for information on the health status of their darling. If their chances of progress beyond the groups with Salah in the ranks were
                  slim, then what would they be without him?
                  
Egypt manager Hector Cuper’s football is not like Klopp’s. It does not get the heart racing and Egypt do not always want to get on the ball and play. They resist, they defend diligently and they pounce when they can. Mahmoud
                  Trezeguet does a job on the counter from the left but Salah on the right is key to all that Cuper asks for.
                  
So those first 24 hours were a living nightmare until confirmation finally came that he would be at the World Cup, the one Egypt had earned the hard way. 
Although this is the first qualification that the team has had since 1990, few Egypt fans would put this side on the level of their recent predecessors; the ones who didn’t get there.
                  
The era of Egypt’s greatest football generation and, perhaps, its greatest player did not coincide. Under Hassan Shehata, the Pharaohs won an unprecedented three Africa Cup of Nations titles between the years of 2006 and 2010.
                  
That was the country’s strongest collective in history. But those teams – boasting regional icons like Mohamed Aboutrika, Ahmed Fathy and skipper Ahmed Hassan – could not break out and take their talents to a World
                  Cup. A ‘derby’ playoff defeat to Algeria in Sudan before 2010 was the closest they got.
                  
There followed a regression for a once-proud giant that cannot be separated from the chaos that descended upon the country in the years following 2011.
                  
Two domestic league seasons were abandoned and not completed; one suspended campaign stemmed from the 2012 Port Said stadium disaster in which 74 people lost their lives.
                  
Following that tragedy, many Egyptian players took the decision to strike out for Europe. Salah was among them after impressing for the national under-23 team in a friendly against Basel, who ended up signing him from El Mokawloon in
                  Cairo.
                  
“When I first arrived in Egypt I saw Salah play with his club team,” Bob Bradley, the former Egypt manager now coaching LAFC in MLS, recalls to Goal.
                  
“He and Mohamed Elneny were on the same team. They were young players but you could see there was something there.
                  
“After Port Said, we started having opportunities to bring young guys into the camps and immediately you knew that Salah was special. 

































“He was hungry, smart, he wanted to get better. He and Aboutrika formed an immediate connection and relationship that really paid off right from the start."
                  
The next year the Premier League season was suspended on security grounds - after the June 2013 street protests. Egypt haven’t won an AFCON since.
                  
It’s no coincidence that Egypt’s continental stock fell when its domestic league was in jeopardy.
                  
Until then, national team players were familiar with each other and were largely drawn from a pool of three or four clubs. They could enjoy a couple of weeks together in international camps while their African rivals – many Europe-based
                  – were often dragged together last minute.
                  
Egypt were more coherent and better organised. Their talent could conquer south of the Sahara, but it could not cross the Mediterranean Sea.
                  
Following the 2011 revolution, the national team failed to qualify for three AFCONs in a row before an unexpected run to the final against Cameroon last January hinted at better days to come. Even in defeat, that demonstrated that a
                  new era could finally begin.
                  
The teams who dominated Africa from 2006 to 2010 were drawn in the most part from Egypt’s finest clubs in Al-Ahly, Zamalek and Ismaily but this Egypt squad heading to the World Cup will for the first time boast plenty of talent
                  based at European clubs. In fact, only eight players in the final 23 are Egypt-based. For the 2010 AFCON, only four were at overseas clubs.
                  
Egyptians have of course come to Europe before – to decent effect – but previous stars appeared ill-equipped to deal with the demands of the game. The likes of Mido and Amr Zaki fell by the wayside despite being every bit
                  as talented as their European or South American counterparts. For reason of culture or lifestyle, they couldn’t cut it.
                  
But here is a squad with that crucial virtue; adaptability. Look around the squad and you’ll see plenty based in England. In the last half-decade, they have come in numbers and that has been to the benefit of the whole country.
                  
“Different football experiences strengthen you and England is the best league in the world,” Sam Morsy, English-born but a full Egypt international, says to Goal.
                  
“Playing in the Premier League is invaluable, you come across some of the best players in the world.
                  
“A few of the lads were great this season. When you’ve got that sort of experience of getting out of your comfort zone and playing in those leagues it strengthens you and makes you better for the national team.”

































It means Egyptians have the capability of facing opponents of a higher international calibre, conjuring answers to different tactical questions and of living to the professional standards of their peers in the big leagues. Salah, in Europe
                  since 2012, is leading the way.
                  
“Momo is a very intelligent and talented player,” Marco Streller, a former team-mate now working as sporting director for Basel, explains to Goal.
                  
“He also has a huge team spirit. He can adapt to a new situation extremely fast.
                  
“It’s not always easy for African players to come to the western world and adapt quickly to a new culture. But Salah did it very fast and very easy. Meanwhile, he never lost or forgot his values or where he came from.
                  
“He laughs and his positive behaviour is so friendly and so natural, it’s very contagious to his team mates.
                  
“Plus, he was extremely focused and trained very hard. He subordinated everything to football and worked hard of course, while having great talent as well.”
                  
For Salah there are no distractions; he lives for football and he is adept at dealing with setbacks. Failure to settle at Chelsea could well have been the death of his career in Europe. But he persisted; took it on the chin and set about
                  rebuilding his career in Italy.
                  
“I think the key to his success was that he took a step back after his big step from Basel to Chelsea,” says Streller.
                  
“This transfer was huge for him and the step maybe a little bit too big. He realised that he maybe had to take a step back to progress. So he left Chelsea for Fiorentina where he learned a lot of the tactics and technical aspects
                  of Italian football.
                  
“At Fiorentina he got stronger and stronger and everybody saw his development. After this he went to Rome – again not a huge step – where he had his breakthrough.
                  
“And now at Liverpool he has the luck that with Jurgen Klopp he met a coach whose game is the perfect match for his playing style. It’s fast and quick shifting from defensive to offensive football. That’s exactly
                  what Salah likes.
                  
“But I really think the key to his success is that he first took a step back and afterwards step by step made it.”
                  
Gradually, bit by bit, he became the player he was destined to become. And by the time that qualifier in Borg al Arab rolled around last October, Salah wrote his name into the history books.
                  
Failure to beat Congo would have necessitated Egypt going to Ghana in their following fixture and obtaining a result. That’s not always an easy ask for them. They shipped six goals there in the first leg of the 2014 play-off.
                  
That failure – and other near misses – were beginning to play on Egyptian minds when Congo equalised Salah’s first goal with only four minutes left on the clock.
                  
“There were so many different emotions through the game,” says Morsy, a substitute that night. “They equalised and then you think we’ve got to go to Ghana and try and get a result.”
                  
But when the time came, Salah was on hand to deliver.
                  
“It was amazing,” says Morsy. “There were over 80,000 people there. The atmosphere was electric. You could feel the passion on the pitch and what it meant. He came up with the magic. It was a really well-taken penalty
                  kick.”
                  
Salah’s rise to the top of the European game was watched from afar by his compatriots but here was the 25-year-old up close and personal in the national stadium. Roma and Liverpool fans – at the Stadio Olimpico and at Anfield
                  – have long been used to Salah settling matches. And now he’s played a major role in one of Egyptian football’s most transformative moments.
                  
“You’ve seen this season in the big games that he always delivers,” says Morsy. “He takes it in his stride. He keeps it simple. He tries his best and that’s all you can do in football. 

































“There’s a huge amount of pressure and expectation on his shoulders but all he can do is his best like any other player in the world.”
                  
When it comes to football Egyptians are modest about their standing in the world. But Salah has begun to give them confidence and belief. The triple African kings demonstrated that Egypt could take on and beat the best the continent
                  had to offer but Salah gives them something different.
                  
He is their first breakout star; the first one to hold a mirror up to Egypt’s young players and say ‘come follow me’. After a club season in which he scored 44 goals, was named PFA and FWA Player of the Year and
                  led Liverpool to the Champions League final, he is the first Egyptian to be in with even half a shout of the Ballon d’Or. “That’s what we all hope and pray for,” says Morsy.
                  
It’s like nothing which has happened before. He’s raised the standard and raised the expectations. He is the reason that Egypt are going to the World Cup and his presence more than anyone else’s makes them feel like
                  they belong there.
                  
“It's a dream to see our player reach this level and become the best player in the English Premier League and a Ballon d'Or contender,” says Nooh. “This player is one of our sons whom we saw growing and
                  we were working on his talent on a daily basis and taking great steps. It makes me proud.”

Read our privacy noticeMohamed Salah is “definitely ready” for Manchester United with Jurgen Klopp praising his quadruple-chasing Liverpool team for the way they have coped without their top scorer but declaring they are a better side with his quality.The Egyptian shone on his return to the Liverpool starting line-up for the first time since New Year’s Day on Thursday against Sparta Prague and scored one goal and made three others in a 6-1 rout.And United have been his favourite opponent over the years with 12 goals against them – more than he has scored against any other club – including eight in his last five matches. The forward scored a hat-trick in a 5-0 win at Old Trafford and two goals in last season’s 7-0 thrashing at Anfield.Now he is set to start against United in Sunday’s FA Cup quarter-final and Klopp said: “Mo is definitely ready. [He is] super good, you saw it last night, how many goals did he set up first half? He scored and was involved in all the others pretty much. Exceptional.“It was a strange game: [in the] second half, I would have loved to take him off but it was not possible because of Bobby [Clark]'s situation and he could manage that pretty well. Even then he set up another goal which was offside.”RecommendedWhy Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool reign hints at bleak future for Erik ten Hag at Man UtdRelentless Mohamed Salah rises above Liverpool’s goalscoring legends with underrated trickJurgen Klopp addresses Liverpool retirement U-turn after Michael Edwards returnWithout Salah, Liverpool lifted the Carabao Cup and won 10 of the 12 matches he missed due to either the African Cup of Nations or injury but Klopp is convinced he improves them again.He added: “Mo is pure quality. Ask him what he likes most about Manchester United but the more we talk about it the less likely it will happen again. Exceptional guy, world-class player and how we dealt without him was unbelievable. Unbelievable. The boys did really well but it is better to have him around and on the pitch than just in the dressing room.

Mohamed Salah Hamed Mahrous Ghaly (Arabic: محمد صلاح حامد محروس غالي, Egyptian Arabic pronunciation: [mæˈħam.mæd sˤɑˈlɑːħ ˈɣæːli];[5] born 15 June 1992), known as Mohamed Salah or Mo Salah, is an Egyptian professional footballer who plays as a right winger or forward for Premier League club Liverpool and captains the Egypt national team. Regarded as one of the best players of his generation and among the greatest African players of all time, he is known for his clinical finishing, dribbling and speed.[6][7][8]
Salah started his senior career in 2010 playing for Al Mokawloon Al Arab, departing in 2012 to join Basel, where he won two Swiss Super League titles. In 2014, Salah joined Chelsea for a reported fee of £11 million, but limited gametime led to successive loans to Fiorentina and Roma, who later signed him permanently for €15 million. In the 2016–17 season, Salah was a key figure in Roma's unsuccessful title bid, reaching double figures in both goals and assists. In 2017, Salah signed for Liverpool for a then-club record transfer of £36.9 million. In his first season, he set the record for most Premier League goals scored (32) in a 38-game season and helped Liverpool to the 2018 UEFA Champions League final. Having formed a formidable attacking trio with Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané after the departure of Philippe Coutinho, Salah went on to be an integral player in the club's Champions League and Premier League title successes in the following two seasons, and has since also won the FA Cup, EFL Cup and FA Community Shield. Salah has achieved numerous individual accolades, including two PFA Players' Player of the Year awards, three Premier League Golden Boots, the Premier League Player of the Season, the Premier League Playmaker of the Season, finished third for the Best FIFA Men's Player in 2018 and 2021, and finished fifth in the 2019 and 2022 FIFA Ballon d'Or. He received the 2018 FIFA Puskás Award for his winning strike in the first Merseyside derby of the 2017–18 season. In 2023, Salah became Liverpool's top Premier League goalscorer, and became the fifth player to score 200 goals for the club.
At international level, Salah represented Egypt at youth level before making his senior debut in 2011. Following his performances at the 2012 Summer Olympics, he was named CAF Most Promising African Talent of the Year. Since then, he finished as runner-up in the 2017 and 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, and was top scorer during CAF qualification as Egypt qualified for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Salah was named CAF African Footballer of the Year (2017 and 2018), BBC African Footballer of the Year (2017 and 2018), and was selected in the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations Team of the Tournament, 2021 Africa Cup of Nations Team of the Tournament and the CAF Team of the Year on several occasions.
Salah is regarded as a symbol of national pride in Egypt for his achievements[9][10] and was named in Time magazine's list of the 100 most influential people in 2019.[11] Salah has also been credited for raising the profile of Liverpool among Egyptians.[12][13] To Egyptians, Salah is known as the "Fourth Pyramid".[14][15] Favoured across the Arab world, Salah is often known as the "Pride of the Arabs".[16][17]


Club career
Al Mokawloon Al Arab
Salah started out playing for the youth setups of local teams Ittihad Basyoun and Othmason Tanta.[18] He names Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane and Francesco Totti as his childhood idols.[19] In 2006, he joined the youth team of Al Mokawloon Al Arab aged 14 after being spotted by a scout who had originally come to watch another child play but was distracted by Salah.[20][21] Salah frequently had to miss school to make the three-hour journey to training.[19] When Salah was 15 he was noticed by then first-team manager Mohamed Radwan, who moved him to the first-team squad immediately. Salah had to be given a special diet and training program due to his muscles not being fully formed because of his young age.[22]
Salah made his first-team debut on 3 May 2010 in the Egyptian Premier League, coming on as a substitute in a 1–1 away draw against El Mansoura.[citation needed] During the 2010–11 season Salah continued earning minutes on the pitch, eventually becoming a regular in the team.[20] Even though he was getting regular game time, Salah struggled to score. In the dressing room after matches he would sometimes be in tears because of this, and Radwan says it only motivated him to become better.[21] He scored his first goal for them on 25 December 2010 in a 1–1 away draw against Al Ahly.[23] He remained a regular for Al Mokawloon, appearing in every game of the 2011–12 season.[24][25] Following the Port Said Stadium riot on 1 February 2012, the Egyptian Premier League was suspended, and on 10 March, the Egyptian Football Association announced their decision to cancel the remainder of the season.[26]

Basel
2012–2013: Development and breakthrough
Salah playing for Basel away at Zenit St Petersburg in the UEFA Europa League in March 2013
Swiss Super League club Basel had been monitoring Salah for some time,[27] so following the Egyptian Premier League suspension, the club organised a friendly match with the Egypt national under-23 team.[28] The match took place on 16 March at the Stadion Rankhof in Basel, and despite only playing the second half, Salah scored twice, helping the Egyptians to a 4–3 win.[29] Basel subsequently invited Salah to remain in the city for a week's training. On 10 April 2012, it was announced that Salah had signed for Basel on a four-year contract starting from 15 June 2012.[30][31][32] He initially found it difficult to settle, having arrived unable to speak the language and been signed as a replacement for Xherdan Shaqiri.[33] Salah scored on his unofficial debut on 23 June 2012 against FCSB during a friendly match, a 4–2 defeat.[34] He made his official Basel debut in a UEFA Champions League preliminary stage match against the Norwegian club Molde on 8 August, coming on as a substitute in the 74th minute.[35] He made his league debut on 12 August against Thun, playing the full match.[36]
He scored his first league goal a week later, the second goal in the 2–0 home win against Lausanne-Sport.[37] Salah scored his first UEFA Europa League goal in the quarter-finals on 11 April 2013, as Basel advanced to the semi-finals by beating Tottenham Hotspur 4–1 in a penalty shoot-out after a 4–4 aggregate draw.[38] In the semi-final on 2 May, Salah scored away to Chelsea, although Basel were beaten 5–2 on aggregate.[39] Despite late disappointment in Europe, Basel won the 2012–13 Swiss Super League title[40] and finished runners-up in the Swiss Cup.[41]

2013–2014: Final season and league championship
Ahead of the 2013–14 Swiss Super League season, Salah was a member of the Basel team that won the 2013 Uhrencup.[42] Salah scored in his first league appearance of the season against Aarau on 13 July 2013.[43] He scored his first Champions League goal a month later against Maccabi Tel Aviv on 6 August 2013 in the third qualifying round.[44] Salah was the subject of major controversy following the game, after he appeared to deliberately avoid shaking hands with the players of the Israeli club in both the home and away legs.[45]
He scored twice against the Bulgarian league champions PFC Ludogorets Razgrad on 21 August 2013 in the play-off round.[46] On 18 September 2013, Salah scored the equaliser against Chelsea in the 2–1 away win during the group stage. During the return tie on 26 November at the St. Jakob-Park, Salah scored the winning goal as Basel beat Chelsea for the second time with a 1–0 home win.[47] However he was unable to prevent Basel being eliminated in the group stage.[48]
On the domestic stage, Salah continued to perform. Scoring 4 goals in 18 games,[49] including a double against title rivals Young Boys,[50] he helped Basel win the league title for the fifth time in a row.[51]
On 23 January 2014, it was announced that Salah would leave Basel.[52] During his time with the club, Salah played a total of 95 games for Basel scoring a total of 21 goals. 47 of these games were in the Swiss Super League, six in the Swiss Cup, 26 in the UEFA competitions (Champions League and Europa League) and 16 were friendly games. He scored nine goals in the domestic league, four in the cup, seven in the European games and the other was scored during the test games.[53]

Chelsea
2014: Entry into first-team squad
On 23 January 2014, Premier League club Chelsea announced that a deal had been agreed with Basel to sign Salah for a fee reported to be in the region of £11 million.[54] Three days later the transfer was completed, making him the first Egyptian to sign for the London-based club.[55] Liverpool had been interested in Salah, and had made an offer of £11 million but were beaten to his signature by Chelsea.[56]
On 8 February, Salah made his debut for Chelsea in the Premier League, coming on as a substitute in the 3–0 win over Newcastle United.[57] Seven games later, on 22 March, Salah scored his first goal for Chelsea against Arsenal in the London Derby, coming on as a substitute for Oscar, in a match which ended as a 6–0 home win.[58] Then, on 5 April, Salah opened the scoring and later won a penalty and assisted the third goal in Chelsea's 3–0 win over Stoke City.[59]

2014–2015: Domestic success
Salah playing for Chelsea in August 2014
Before the 2014–15 season, Salah's future with Chelsea looked to be in doubt after reports suggested he could be forced to return to Egypt to carry out military service after his registration for an education scheme was rescinded by the Egyptian Minister of Higher Education.[60] He was spared of military service after a meeting with the then Egyptian prime minister Ibrahim Mahlab, the Minister of Higher Education, and the Egypt national team manager Shawky Gharieb.[61] Salah changed squad numbers from 15 to 17 for the start of the season, with his new number having been vacated by Eden Hazard changing to number 10.[62]
Salah was rarely used during the season, making just three Premier League, two Champions League and three cup appearances, failing to score in any of them. On 28 October 2014, after a poor performance in a 2–1 win away League Two team Shrewsbury Town in the fourth round of the League Cup, he and fellow winger André Schürrle were criticised publicly by manager José Mourinho.[63] Although Salah only made three league appearances before his loan move to Fiorentina, Mourinho stated that he would receive a replica winner's medal from the club for his contributions that season.[64]

2015: Loan to Fiorentina
Salah playing for Fiorentina against Dynamo Kyiv in 2015
On the transfer deadline day, 2 February 2015, Chelsea confirmed that Salah would join Italian club Fiorentina on an 18-month loan until the end of the 2015–16 season, as part of a transfer deal which saw Juan Cuadrado moving in the opposite direction. Six days after signing, he made his debut coming off the bench in the 65th minute as a replacement for Joaquín in a 3–2 home victory against Atalanta in Serie A.[65] Salah chose the number 74 shirt in honour of the victims of the Port Said Stadium riot.[66][67][68]
Salah made his first start for Fiorentina on 14 February against Sassuolo, scoring his first goal for the club in the 30th minute. He then provided an assist to Khouma Babacar just two minutes after scoring; the match ended in a 3–1 win for Fiorentina.[69] Twelve days later, Salah scored his first European goal for Fiorentina, as his side advanced to the round of sixteen of the Europa League, beating Tottenham 3–1 on aggregate.[70][71] Salah scored the winning goal for Fiorentina against Inter Milan on 1 March, his third goal in Serie A.[72] Four days after that, Salah scored both of Fiorentina's goals in their 2–1 win away to Juventus in the Coppa Italia semi-final first leg.[73] At the end of the season, Fiorentina activated an option to make the loan move permanent, but Salah refused the move. Even though the loan agreement was for 18 months, Salah refused to return to Fiorentina and instead joined fellow Serie A club Roma.[74][75] On 11 September, Fiorentina filed a complaint to FIFA, claiming that Chelsea had breached the agreed contract when they allowed Salah to join Roma on loan.[76] The Court of Arbitration for Sport cleared Salah and Chelsea of any wrongdoing.[77]

2015–2016: Loan to Roma
On 6 August 2015, Salah joined Roma on a season-long loan for €5 million; with the option to make the deal permanent,[78][79] for a reported €15 million.[80] He wore the number 11 shirt.[81] He made his debut on 22 August, as the new season began with a 1–1 draw away Hellas Verona.[82] On 20 September, Salah scored his first goal of the season against Sassuolo to help Roma salvage a point as the match ended in a 2–2 draw.[83] He went on to score in his following two matches, a 2–1 loss against Sampdoria and a 5–1 win against Carpi.[84][85] On 25 October, Salah scored the opener against his former club Fiorentina in a 2–1 away victory to help earn a fourth straight league win for Roma. On his return, Salah was also sent off after picking up a second yellow in the closing minutes of the match, just seconds after picking up his first yellow.[86][87] On 4 November, he scored the opening goal of a 3–2 Champions League win over Bayer Leverkusen.[88]
On 4 March, he faced his former side Fiorentina again and scored another double as Roma won 4–1 and broke into the top three.[89] Salah would go onto score another three goals that season, scoring against Bologna, Genoa, and AC Milan, the latter on the final day.[90][91][92] In the 2015–16 season, Salah scored 15 goals in 42 matches as Roma finished in third place in Serie A and qualified for the Champions League.[93] In June, it was announced that Salah won the club's 2015–16 Player of the Season award.[94]

Roma
2016–2017: Permanent transfer, Serie A runner-up
On 3 August 2016, Roma announced the signing of Salah on a permanent deal for €15 million.[95][96] He scored his first goal of the season in a 4–0 win over Udinese in the opening game of the season on 20 August.[97] On 6 November, Salah scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 win over Bologna, his first club career hat-trick.[98] However, a ruptured ankle ligament kept him out for the first half of December.[99] He returned as a half-time substitute in a 1–0 defeat against title rivals Juventus on 17 December.[100] Salah then endured a two-month period without a goal, he broke his drought on 19 February, scoring against Torino in a 4–1 win.[101] On 9 March, he scored Roma's opening goal in an eventual 4–2 defeat to Lyon in the first leg of the round of sixteen in the 2016–17 Europa League.[102] Despite winning the second leg 2–1, they were unable to turn the tie around and were knocked out 5–4 on aggregate.[103] On 28 May, in the final game of the season, Salah was substituted for captain Francesco Totti, who was playing his final game with the club, in a 3–2 win over Genoa.[104][105] Roma finished the season in second, just four points behind champions Juventus.[106] Salah scored 19 goals in all competitions.[107]

Liverpool
2017–2018: Record-breaking individual success
Salah playing for Liverpool in 2017. His performances in the 2017–18 season saw him receive numerous accolades, including PFA Players' Player of the Year and the Football Writers' Player of the Year.
On 22 June 2017, Salah agreed a transfer to Premier League club Liverpool. He signed a long-term contract with the Reds for an initial £36.5m fee that could rise to £43m.[108] The fee was a club record, eclipsing the £35m spent on Andy Carroll in 2011.[109] He was assigned the number 11 shirt previously worn by Roberto Firmino who instead switched to number 9.[110] He joined the club on 1 July upon the opening of the summer transfer window, becoming Liverpool's first Egyptian player.[111] He scored on his Premier League debut against Watford in a 3–3 away draw on 12 August.[112] On 24 August, Salah scored his second goal for Liverpool, in a 2017–18 Champions League play-off round 4–2 win (6–3 agg) against 1899 Hoffenheim, his first goal at Anfield.[113] Three days later, Salah scored and assisted a goal in a 4–0 victory over Arsenal.[114] For his performances in August, Salah was awarded Player of the Month by Liverpool supporters.[115] On 17 October, Salah netted twice in a 7–0 Champions League win over Maribor, helping Liverpool to the joint-largest ever away win in the competition, and the largest away win by an English club.[116]

On 26 November 2017, Salah scored the opener and refused to celebrate in a 1–1 home draw with his former team Chelsea out of respect for the club as well as victims of the Sinai Mosque attack two days earlier.[118] Salah rose the top of the Premier League goalscoring charts by scoring twice after coming on as a substitute away at Stoke City on 29 November in a 3–0 win.[119] The following month, Salah netted in a 4–0 win over AFC Bournemouth; a result which saw Liverpool become the first team in Premier League history to win four consecutive away league matches by a margin of at least three goals.[120] In the process, he also became the joint-second fastest player to reach 20 goals for Liverpool on his 26th appearance, behind George Allan who reached the milestone in 19 appearances in 1895.[121] On 17 March 2018, Salah scored four goals in a 5–0 win over Watford, which was his first hat-trick for Liverpool. In this game, he also broke a record of scoring 36 times in his debut season for Liverpool, and also became the leading goalscorer in Europe's top five leagues – overtaking Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Tottenham striker Harry Kane. Following Salah's record-breaking goal exploits former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard stated "we are witnessing the start of greatness".[122]
In early April 2018, he scored in both Champions League quarter-final matches against Manchester City to help his side advance.[123] On 22 April 2018, Salah was awarded the PFA Players' Player of the Year award,[124] having earlier been named in the PFA Team of the Year for the Premier League.[125] Two days later, he scored a brace in a 5–2 Champions League semi-final first leg win over former club, Roma. In doing so, he simultaneously became the first player from Africa and the first Liverpool player to score 10 goals in a single campaign in the tournament. His double also took him to 43 goals for the season across all competitions, surpassing Roger Hunt's tally of 42, and making him Liverpool's second-highest goalscorer in a single season, behind Ian Rush.[126] He had previously also broken the club's record for the Premier League era, surpassing Robbie Fowler's total of 36 goals set in the 1995–96 campaign, and Fernando Torres' record of 33 for the most goals by a Liverpool player in a debut season.[127] After his two goals and assists in the first leg against Roma, Salah featured in the second leg as Liverpool beat Roma 7–6 on aggregate to qualify for the final for the first time in eleven years.[128] He would then become the Premier League's all-time goalscorer for a 38-game season, registering his 32nd league goal in a 4–0 win against Brighton & Hove Albion en route to being awarded the Premier League Golden Boot.[129]
In the 2018 Champions League final against Real Madrid, Salah injured his left shoulder in the 30th minute after a challenge by Madrid defender Sergio Ramos.[130] After initially carrying on, he left the field in tears after going to ground again;[131] the match ended in a 3–1 defeat. The Egyptian FA stated that this would have no effect on his availability for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia, and that Salah would still be named in the team's final squad on 4 June.[132] The day after the match, Ramos wrote a message and sent him good wishes.[133]

On 2 July 2018, Salah signed a new long-term contract with Liverpool.[134] Manager Jürgen Klopp said the news was important as a statement of intent in terms of Liverpool's status in the football world in having Salah commit himself further to the club.[135] On 12 August, Salah scored Liverpool's first goal of the season, in a 4–0 home win over West Ham United.[136][137] On 30 August, Salah was named on the three-man shortlist for the UEFA Men's Player of the Year, coming in third place,[138] and was also included on the three-man shortlist for the UEFA Forward of the Season, coming in second place.[139][140][141] On 3 September he was named on the three-man shortlist for the Best FIFA Men's Player, finishing third.[142][143] Salah controversially received the 2018 FIFA Puskás Award for goal of the year, the winning strike his goal at Anfield in his first Merseyside derby,[144][145] prompting online protests against the decision.[146][147] On 24 October, Salah scored twice against Red Star Belgrade in the 2018–19 Champions League group stage, with his second goal his 50th for the club.[148] With 50 goals in 65 games he is the fastest player in Liverpool history to reach the half century.[148]
On 3 December, Salah was ranked in sixth place at the 2018 Ballon d'Or ceremony, as a recognition for his performances with club and country throughout 2018.[149] On 8 December, Salah scored a hat-trick in a 4–0 away win over Bournemouth, to move Liverpool to the top of the league table.[150] Three days later, he scored the winning goal in a 1–0 win over Napoli in their final Champions League group fixture, the result qualifying Liverpool to the round of sixteen.[151] On 19 January 2019, he scored his 50th Premier League goal with a brace in a 4–3 win over Crystal Palace, reaching the tally in 72 appearances. In doing so, he became the joint-fourth fastest player to achieve the milestone, alongside Fernando Torres, and behind only Andy Cole, Alan Shearer and Ruud van Nistelrooy.[152]

In February 2019, West Ham said they were investigating a video which allegedly showed fans racially abusing Salah, including for being Muslim.[153] The investigation resulted in the fan being banned for three years.[154] On 5 April, he scored his 50th Premier League goal for Liverpool in a 3–1 win over Southampton and in the process broke Torres' record to become the fastest player to reach the milestone for the club, doing so in his 69th appearance.[155] It also saw him become the third fastest player to reach the milestone for a single club in the Premier League era, behind Shearer for Blackburn Rovers, in 66

appearances, and Van Nistelrooy for Manchester United, in 68 appearances.[157] Later that month, he scored the second goal, a powerful strike from 25 yards out that flew into the top corner, in a 2–0 win over Chelsea which helped Liverpool earn a club-record-equaling 26th win for the Premier League campaign; and the club's second-highest ever wins return in the top flight after the record of 30 set in 1979.[158] On 26 April, he made his 100th appearance for Liverpool and broke the record jointly held by Roger Hunt and Sam Raybould for the player with the most goals in his first century of appearances for the club, netting twice in a 5–0 win over Huddersfield Town to take his tally to 69.[159]
On 1 June, after missing the semi-final due to injury, Salah scored Liverpool's first goal in a 2–0 win over Tottenham in the 2019 Champions League final from a penalty.[160] Salah's goal, which he scored in the opening two minutes of the match, was the second fastest goal ever scored in a Champions League final, slower only than Paolo Maldini's effort for AC Milan against Liverpool in the 2005 final.[161] In September 2019, Salah was nominated for the FIFA FIFPro World11 award by worldwide players’ union, FIFPro, and FIFA as one among 55 players.[162]

2019–2020: Premier League champion
Salah playing for Liverpool in the 2019 UEFA Super Cup
On 9 August 2019, Salah scored Liverpool's second goal in a 4–1 win against Norwich City in the opening game of the 2019–20 Premier League season.[163] In the 2019 UEFA Super Cup on 14 August, Salah scored Liverpool's fifth and ultimately decisive penalty in a 5–4 penalty shoot-out win against Chelsea, after the game had finished 2–2 after extra time.[164][165] In December, Salah ended fifth in the voting polls for the 2019 Ballon d'Or, and made his 100th Premier League appearance later in the month, marking the occasion with a goal and assist in Liverpool's 3–0 win over Bournemouth.[166][167] Later that month, Liverpool won the 2019 FIFA Club World Cup, with Salah receiving the Golden Ball award for Player of the Tournament.[168]
On 19 January 2020, Salah scored his first goal in five encounters against rivals Manchester United, with a run that spanned from outside his box to the other goal in Liverpool's 2–0 home win in the Premier League.[169][170] On 29 January, Salah scored Liverpool's opening goal in a 2–0 away win against West Ham, a victory that saw the club beat every team in a Premier League season – the first time in the club's 127-year history that they had accomplished it in the top flight.[171] On 7 March, Salah scored the opening goal in a 2–1 win against Bournemouth as Liverpool made it an English top-flight record of 22 consecutive home wins. It was also his 70th Premier League goal in 100 appearances for Liverpool, meaning that he had scored seven more goals than the previous best in their first 100 league games for the club (63 goals by Fernando Torres).[172] Salah's 20th of the season saw him become the first Liverpool player to score 20 goals in all competitions in three consecutive seasons since Michael Owen between 2000–01 and 2002–03.[173] On 24 June 2020, he scored as Liverpool beat Crystal Palace 4–0 at home, as the team edged closer to securing the title.[174] After Liverpool being confirmed as champions,[175] Salah would go on to score a further two goals (both against Brighton)[176] before lifting the Premier League trophy after a 5–3 victory over Chelsea.[177]

2020–2021: 100th Liverpool goal and more records
On 12 September 2020, Salah scored a hat-trick in the first league match of a season, including two penalties, in a 4–3 win against Leeds United.[178] Hence, he became the first Liverpool player to score in four consecutive league openers from the 2017–18 to 2020–21 seasons, and the second man in Premier League history, after Teddy Sheringham from the 1992–93 to 1995–96 seasons.[179] He also became the first player to score a hat-trick for Liverpool in the first league match since John Aldridge achieved this feat in the 1988–89 season.[180] On 17 October 2020, he scored his 100th goal for Liverpool in all competitions in a 2–2 away draw against Everton.[181] In scoring his 100th goal in his 159th game, Salah became the first player since Steven Gerrard in 2008 to reach the milestone, and the third fastest in Liverpool's history after Roger Hunt (100 goals in 144 games), and Jack Parkinson (153 games).[182] Salah is the fastest to reach 100 goals for Liverpool while scoring purely in England's top flight, given that both Hunt and Parkinson scored some of their goals for Liverpool in the Football League Second Division.[183]
On 31 January 2021, Salah scored two goals against West Ham and became the fifth Liverpool player to score more than 20 goals in all competitions in four consecutive seasons, and the first since Ian Rush did so six times running from 1981–82 to 1986–87.[184] In addition, his goal in the 68th minute that game was later voted as Premier League Goal of the Month.[185][186] On 24 April, he scored in a 1–1 draw with Newcastle United, to become the first Liverpool player to score 20 goals in three different Premier League campaigns.[187] On 13 May, he scored a goal in a 4–2 away win over Manchester United, to be his team's first away win at Old Trafford since March 2014.[188] Moreover, he also became the only player to score at Old Trafford for Liverpool in two different games in a season, having scored twice in a 3–2 defeat in the FA Cup, since Harry Chambers in the 1920–21 season.[189]

Salah opened the 2021–22 season with a goal and two assists in a 3–0 win away to Norwich, becoming the first player to score in the opening game of five consecutive Premier League seasons.[190] On 12 September, Salah scored his 100th Premier League goal in the 3–0 win away to Leeds United.[191] On 25 September, Salah scored his 100th Premier League goal for Liverpool in a 3–3 draw away to Brentford. Reaching 100 top-flight goals in fewer games than any player in Liverpool history, he achieved the milestone in 151 games, one game fewer than Roger Hunt who reached a century of goals in 152 games.[192] The goal also moved Salah into Liverpool's top 10 all-time scorers list.[193]



"We don't have to talk about what Messi and Ronaldo have done for world football and their dominance. But right now, he [Salah] is the best. I see him every day. There are people like Lewandowski and Ronaldo and Messi and Mbappe, but at this moment for sure he's on top of that list."

On 19 October 2021, Salah became the first player in Liverpool history to score in nine consecutive games with two goals in a 3–2 win away to Atlético Madrid in the Champions League. His second goal, his 31st in the Champions League, saw him become Liverpool's record goalscorer in the competition, surpassing the 30 goals scored by Steven Gerrard.[195] In his next game on 24 October Salah continued breaking records with a hat-trick against Liverpool's arch rivals Manchester United in a 5–0 away victory.[196] In scoring three goals Salah became the highest scoring African player in Premier League history (surpassing the 104 goals scored by Didier Drogba), and the first Liverpool player to score in ten consecutive games as well as the first Liverpool player to score at Old Trafford three games in a row.[197][198] He also became the first opposition player to score a hat-trick at Old Trafford since Ronaldo in 2003, and the first to do so in Premier League history.[196][198] On 3 October 2021, Salah scored a goal against Manchester City after dribbling through their defence.[199] The goal was later named the Premier League Goal of the Month[200] and the Premier League Goal of the Season for 2021–22.[4] On 1 December, Salah scored twice in a 4–1 away win against Everton in the Premier League as Liverpool became the first team in English top-flight history to score at least two goals in 18 successive games in all competitions.[201]
On 7 December 2021, Salah scored Liverpool's opening goal in a 2–1 away win against AC Milan at the San Siro as Liverpool became the first English club to win all six Champions League group games in the competition's history. The goal was Salah's 20th of the season and he became the first Liverpool player since Ian Rush to score 20 goals in five successive seasons.[202] On 16 December, Salah scored Liverpool's second goal in a 3–1 home win against Newcastle United, the 15th consecutive Premier League game he either scored or made an assist, in what was Liverpool's 2,000th top-flight win.[203] On 19 February 2022, Salah became the 10th player to score 150 goals in all competitions for the club, and the second fastest (232 matches) after Roger Hunt (226), when he scored the second goal in a 3–1 Premier League win over Norwich at Anfield.[204] On 19 April, Salah became the first Premier League Player to score 5 goals against Manchester United in a single season after scoring a brace in a 4–0 win at Anfield.[205] On 29 April, Salah was named England's Men's Footballer of the Year for the second time since 2018.[206] On 22 May, Salah was awarded his third Golden Boot award at the end of the Premier League 2021–22 season, sharing the award with Son Heung-min after both players scored 23 goals. Salah also won the Playmaker of the Season award after collecting 13 assists.[207] Salah earned a runners-up medal in the 2021–22 Champions League, losing the final to Real Madrid.[208] Liverpool narrowly missed out on the chance to achieve a historic quadruple, coming second in the 2021–22 Premier League and the Champions League but winning both the EFL Cup and the FA Cup.[209]

2022–2023: Contract extension and European records
Salah (right) playing for Liverpool in 2022 against RB Leipzig
On 1 July 2022, Salah signed a new contract with Liverpool, lasting until at least 2025.[210] On 30 July, Salah scored a penalty and assisted a goal in a 3–1 FA Community Shield victory against Manchester City.[211] On 6 August, Salah began the new Premier League campaign by scoring one goal and assisting another in a 2–2 draw away at Fulham. With his eighth goal in Premier League opening matches, he became the first player to score on the opening day six seasons in a row, and equalled the record of total goals on opening days set by Wayne Rooney, Frank Lampard and Alan Shearer.[212] On 12 October, Salah came off the bench in a Champions League match away to Rangers, before scoring three goals in the space of six minutes and twelve seconds of an eventual 7–1 win.[213] This saw him break Bafétimbi Gomis' record for the fastest Champions League hat-trick of all time.[214] With 38 goals, he also became the highest goalscorer for an English side, beating out Didier Drogba and Sergio Aguero.[215] On 17 October, Salah was voted in fifth place for the Ballon D'or ceremony.[216]
On 7 January 2023, Salah surpassed Kenny Dalglish for sixth place on the club's all-time top scorers' list, taking his tally for the club to 173 from 280 matches, when he scored the second goal in a 2–2 home draw against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the FA Cup.[217] On 21 February, Salah became Liverpool's top goalscorer in European competitions after scoring the second goal of the Champions League match against Real Madrid in the first leg of the round of sixteen.[218] Despite being defeated by Real Madrid in both legs of the round of sixteen and not advancing further in the competition, Salah finished the 2022–23 Champions League as the second-highest goalscorer in the competition, behind only Erling Haaland.[219] Moreover, on 5 March, Salah scored two goals and delivered two assists against Manchester United in a 7–0 win and became Liverpool's all-time top scorer in the Premier League with 129 goals, overtaking Robbie Fowler's tally of 128. Salah also became the first Liverpool player to score against Manchester United in five consecutive games.[220] With his first goal against Manchester United, Salah became the highest scoring Egyptian ever with 303 career goals, surpassing Hossam Hassan who had scored 302 goals for club & country in all competitions between 1985 and 2007. On 6 May, Salah became the first player in Liverpool history to score in nine successive games at Anfield with his 100th goal at the stadium.[221] On 15 May, Salah completed his first-ever hat-trick of assists in a Premier League match in 3–0 away win against Leicester City.[222] At the end of the 2022–23 season, Liverpool narrowly missed out on Champions League qualification, with Salah describing himself as "totally devastated".[223] Despite this, Salah was widely praised as one of the best performers in the Premier League that season.[224][225]

2023–present
In the preseason of the 2023–24 season, Salah was the recipient of a two-year contract offer worth £155m from Saudi Pro League side Al-Ittihad.[226] Had Salah accepted the offer, he would have joined his former teammate Fabinho in Jeddah and Liverpool would have received a £52m transfer fee. However, the agent of Salah, Ramy Abbas Issa, stated on 7 August 2023 that his client was "committed" to Liverpool.[226] On 1 September 2023, Al-Ittihad sent an offer worth £150 million to sign him. However, the deal was eventually turned down by Liverpool on the same day.[227] In the 2023–24 season, Salah moved into a playmaker role on the pitch, with manager Jürgen Klopp stating that now the situation was "slightly different, especially with Darwin [Núñez] when he… [was] playing". Klopp further opined that Salah was "smart enough to adapt to all these different things" and that he was "in all phases world class".[228]
On 21 October 2023, Salah scored the 200th and 201st league goals of his career with a brace in the Merseyside derby.[229] On 26 October, Salah scored the last goal in a 5–1 victory against Toulouse to become the highest-scoring Premier League player in European competitions, overtaking Thierry Henry.[230][231] On 29 October, with Salah scoring in a 3–0 victory against Nottingham Forest, he became the third player in Liverpool history to achieve the feat of scoring in each of the opening five home league matches of a season, after Harry Chambers and John Aldridge. Chambers and Aldridge made this achievement in 1922 and 1987 respectively.[232] On 9 December, Salah scored his 200th goal for Liverpool in a 2–1 win away to Crystal Palace in the Premier League to become the fifth player at the club to reach the landmark, following Ian Rush, Roger Hunt, Gordon Hodgson and Billy Liddell.[233]
On 14 March 2024, he netted a goal in a 6–1 win over Sparta Prague in the Europa League round of 16, in which he became the first player to score at least 20 goals in seven consecutive seasons for Liverpool, breaking Ian Rush's previous record of six between 1981–82 and 1986–87.[234]

International career
Youth
Salah played for both the Egypt national under-20 and under-23 team, representing Egypt in both the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup and the 2012 Summer Olympics,[235] scoring a penalty against Argentina in the round of sixteen of the former tournament, with Egypt losing the match 2–1.[236]
Salah was selected for the Egypt squad to play at the 2012 Summer Olympics[237] scoring in all three of the team's group games. In their opening match on 26 July, he scored Egypt's second goal in a 3–2 defeat to Brazil.[238] He scored the equaliser in their 1–1 draw against New Zealand on 29 July,[239] before scoring Egypt's opening goal in a 3–1 win over Belarus in their final group stage game played on 1 August,[240] securing advancement into the knockout stage of the tournament, where Egypt were eliminated following a 3–0 quarter-final defeat to Japan on 4 August.[241]

Style of play
Analysis
Salah (pictured in 2018) is best known for his speed, dribbling ability and finishing.
Regarded as a quick, mobile, hard-working and tactical player, with good technique and an eye for goal, Salah is predominantly known for his speed, movement, clinical finishing, agility, dribbling skills, first touch, and ball control, as well as his ability to use both his pace and flair on the ball to beat opponents, and create scoring opportunities for himself or his teammates.[275][276][277][278][279] In recent years, Salah's playmaking has started to receive increased recognition; he recorded 25 assists across the 2021–22 and 2022–23 Premier League seasons, compared to 33 assists across the four seasons prior to this.[280] A versatile forward, he primarily plays as a winger on the right flank, a position which allows him to cut into the centre onto his stronger left foot, and either shoot on goal or play quick exchanges with other players and make runs in behind the defence towards goal. He can also play in the centre behind the main striker as either an attacking midfielder or second striker.[281]
On his increased threat in front of goal since joining Liverpool, Salah credits Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp's request for him to occupy more advanced central positions, often operating as a main striker, with the forward telling ESPN, "I play closer to the goal than any club before."[276][277][282] Salah initially started his career at the left-back position, however, following a 4–0 win over the youth team of Egyptian club ENPPI, Salah was in tears for not scoring after missing several clear chances; this made his coach realise his passion for scoring goals, forcing him to move him to a forward position.[283][284]

Reception
Salah is regarded by several pundits and footballing figures as one of the best players in the world and one of the best African players of all time.[285][286][287] While Salah was playing at Al Mokawloon, American coach Bob Bradley saw Salah play and noted his prodigious speed, explosiveness, and intelligence on the pitch, already evident at his young age.[288] Upon signing for Chelsea, José Mourinho said of Salah: "He's young, he's fast, he's creative, he's enthusiastic. When we analysed him he looks the kind of humble personality on the pitch, ready to work for the team."[289] Mourinho added that Salah has "similar qualities" with "talented players" that he had worked with, such as Gareth Bale and Arjen Robben.[290] His technical skills, pace, left foot, goalscoring, position and direct playing style led him to be nicknamed the "Egyptian Messi", in the Italian media.[291][292] Brazilian World Cup winner Ronaldo – whom Salah idolised while growing up – stated, "Salah is an incredible player with a tremendous quality. He looks like Messi."[293][294] Salah has also received praise for his refusal to celebrate against his former clubs.[295]

Personal life
Salah and his wife, Maggi, married in 2013. Their daughter, Makka, born in 2014,[296] is named in honour of the Islamic holy city of Mecca.[288] They welcomed a second daughter, Kayan, in 2020.[297] Salah is Muslim and celebrates goals by performing the sujud.[298] On this goal celebration, Salah told CNN, "It's something like praying or thanking God for what I have received, but yeah, it's just praying and praying for a win. I've always done that since I was young, everywhere."[299]
Salah enjoys playing football on his PlayStation, and has confessed jokingly that "Salah in the video game is stronger than the real one".[300] Salah has also revealed that his favourite food is kushari, an Egyptian working class dish in origin that is usually made from rice, pasta and lentils and topped with a variety of options including spiced tomatoes, chickpeas and onions.[301]
During the 2018 Egyptian presidential election, a large number of spoilt ballot papers, possibly more than a million, involved voters crossing out both names and writing Salah's name instead.[302][303]

Outside football
Sponsors
Salah has a sponsorship deal with sportswear and equipment supplier Adidas: he wears a special edition Adidas X Crazyfast+ football boots called Egyptian Nights.[304] He appeared in an Adidas 2018 World Cup commercial along with other players who are also sponsored by them, including David Beckham, Lionel Messi, Paul Pogba and singer Pharrell Williams.[305]
In March 2018, Salah appeared in an advertisement for Vodafone Egypt. Filmed visiting several Merseyside landmarks, the video was originally released in Arabic (but was also translated to English).[306] A month later, he mentioned that he was "insulted" after his image was displayed across the national team's plane without his permission before the start of the World Cup that year, as the official sponsor of the national team, WE, is a rival of his sponsor.[307]

Charity
Salah is active in regeneration projects in Nagrig, his hometown where most people live in poverty, donating money to help build a school and hospital.[308][309] The project includes the construction of an Al-Azhar institute and an ambulance unit. In an interview with Al-Masry Al-Youm, Salah's father claimed that his son refused to accept any financial assistance with the project.[310]
During his time in Egypt, Salah's family was once robbed, however, the thief was caught and arrested by police, with Salah's father preparing to press charges against him, but Mohamed convinced him to drop the case. Afterwards, Salah helped the thief financially, giving him some money and trying to find him a job.[311] In February 2018, following a match against Tottenham, Salah donated a replica shirt to young supporter Mohamed Abdel Karim, who was previously pictured wearing a jumper reading Salah's name and shirt number.[312] Moreover, Mohamed Salah has helped more than 450 families by giving them monthly allowances and he also helped the government by giving approximately $300,000 when the country was experiencing an economic crisis.[313]
On 13 August 2022, a fire broke out at Abu Sefein Church in Giza, Egypt, with 41 people losing their lives as a result. Salah subsequently expressed his condolences on social media,[314] and made a donation of three million Egyptian pounds to help rebuild the church.[315]
During the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, Salah called for humanitarian aid to be allowed into the Gaza Strip and for the "massacres" and the "slaughter of innocent civilians" to stop.[316] Salah also donated an undisclosed amount to support the Palestinian people.[317]

In popular culture

The most popular chant for Salah was made by Liverpool supporters where they called him the Egyptian King – "Mo Salah! Mo Salah! Mo Salah! Running down the wing. Mo Salah la-la-la la-ahh, The Egyptian King!",[318] they also created another chant to the tune of Dodgy's "Good Enough", saying that if Salah continued to score goals, they would convert to Islam – "If he's good enough for you, he's good enough for me, if he scores another few, then I'll be Muslim too."[319] Salah has given his approval to the chant, and it has been cited as an example of inclusivity.[320] According to a 2021 study in the American Political Science Review, Salah's transfer to Liverpool led to a 16% reduction in hate crimes in the city, as well as reducing Islamophobic online rhetoric by Liverpool fans.[321] Salah is devout to a degree that many other well-known Muslims sports figures are not, and his charm and apolitical persona have made him a popular figure in the UK.[288] During his goal celebration, Salah lays in the prostrate position to thank God in sujud.[322]
Salah is nicknamed "The Pharaoh" by the press and his fans.[323][324][325] He has also been given the nickname "Egyptian King" by Liverpool supporters,[326][327] arising from a chant set to the tune of "Sit Down" by English indie rock band James.[328]
Following his goal that led Egypt to the World Cup finals for the first time since 1990, a school in Egypt was named after him.[329] Following Egypt's exit from the World Cup, Salah stayed in his home country for his pre-season holiday. In late June, his address was accidentally leaked on Facebook. After this, crowds of fans showed up at Salah's house, with Salah greeting the fans and signing autographs for some, although according to reports in Spain, police did arrive to cordon off his house.[330]
During Liverpool's 2018 pre-season tour in the U.S., American artist Brandan Odums created a mural in the Times Square area displaying Salah in the Egypt kit, with the player later posting an image on social media posing next to it.[331][332] In Egypt, several murals have also been created displaying Salah's likeness, including one in the capital of Cairo.[333][334]
A testament to his influence in the region and globally, Salah was featured on the cover of two major magazines in 2018: GQ Middle East (feature story titled "The Unstoppable Rise of Mo Salah")[335] and Time magazine's 2019 Time 100 edition.[336] An advocate of women's equality in the Middle East, Salah (in his Time 100 entry) states, "We need to change the way we treat women in our culture".[337] English comedian, and noted Liverpool fan, John Oliver wrote Salah's feature in the Time 100 issue.[336] Oliver notably started the feature writing "Mo Salah is a better human being than he is a football player. And he's one of the best football players in the world."[338] Despite being named as the "GQ Middle East Man of The Year" in 2019, another GQ photoshoot, with Brazilian model Alessandra Ambrosio, caused him some criticism in the Islamic world.[339] In January 2020, it was announced that Salah would be honoured with a wax statue at Madame Tussauds in London.[340]

Being religious yet apolitical is partly what has made Salah appealing to the predominantly white fan base of England's Premier League.

"He is able to effectively erode negative views of Muslims and challenge Islamophobia" just by being himself.

Lionel Andrés "Leo" Messi[note 1] (Spanish pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes ˈmesi] ⓘ; born 24 June 1987) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Major League Soccer club Inter Miami and the Argentina national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record eight Ballon d'Or awards, a record six European Golden Shoes, and was named the world's best player for a record eight times by FIFA.[note 2] Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles, and the UEFA Champions League four times.[note 3] With his country, he won the 2021 Copa América and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals in La Liga (474), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions League (eight), and most assists in La Liga (192) and the Copa América (17). He also has the most international goals by a South American male (106). Messi has scored over 800 senior career goals for club and country, and has the most goals by a player for a single club (672).
Messi relocated to Spain from Argentina aged 13 to join Barcelona, for whom he made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning four consecutive Ballons d'Or, making him the first player to win the award four times. During the 2011–12 season, he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived career rival), before regaining his best form during the 2014–15 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and won a record sixth Ballon d'Or in 2019. Out of contract, he signed for French club Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021, spending two seasons at the club and winning Ligue 1 twice. Messi joined American club Inter Miami in July 2023, winning the Leagues Cup in August of that year.
An Argentine international, Messi is the country's all-time leading goalscorer and also holds the national record for appearances. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, finishing the tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with his compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup (2006), and reached the final of the 2007 Copa América, where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, for which he won the Golden Ball, the 2015 Copa América, winning the Golden Ball, and the 2016 Copa América. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a third-place finish at the 2019 Copa América, and victory in the 2021 Copa América, while winning the Golden Ball and Golden Boot for the latter. That same year, Messi received a seventh Ballon d'Or. In 2022, he led Argentina to win the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where he won a record second Golden Ball, scored seven goals including two in the final, and broke the record for most games played at the World Cup (26), later receiving his record-extending eighth Ballon d'Or in 2023.
Messi has endorsed sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2019 and 2022. Messi was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, 2012, and 2023. In 2020 and 2023, he was named the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year, with Messi being the first team-sport athlete to win the award. In 2020, Messi was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team and became the second footballer and second team-sport athlete to surpass $1 billion in career earnings.


Early life
Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe,[12] the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the north-central Adriatic Marche region of Italy, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry.[3] Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, "Leo" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers.[13] At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches.[14] He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Roman Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother.[15][16]



"When you saw him you would think: this kid can't play ball. He's a dwarf, he's too fragile, too small. But immediately you'd realise that he was born different, that he was a phenomenon and that he was going to be something impressive."


– Newell's Old Boys youth coach Adrián Coria shares his first impression of the 12-year-old Messi.[17]

A lifelong supporter of Newell's Old Boys, Messi joined the Rosario club when he was six years old. During the six years he played for Newell's, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of "The Machine of '87", the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of the first team's home games.[18][19] However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, aged 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. As his father's health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone treatment, which cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise.[20] He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker Pablo Aimar he idolised.[21][22] It was speculated that he failed to be signed into River Plate due to his ill health, however in a 2019 interview, Messi revealed that the club had offered to pay for his medical treatment despite ultimately rejecting him.[23] His goalscoring idol growing up was Brazilian striker Ronaldo, with Messi calling him "the best forward I've ever seen".[24]

Messi enrolled at Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, aged 13.
As the Messi family had relatives in Catalonia, they sought to arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000. First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin.[21][25] In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister, María Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.[18][25][26]
After a year at Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, Messi was finally enrolled in the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) in February 2002. Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were Cesc Fàbregas and Gerard Piqué.[27] After completing his growth hormone treatment aged 14,[28] Messi became an integral part of the "Baby Dream Team", Barcelona's greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (2002–03), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the Cadetes A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups.[27][29] The Copa Catalunya final, a 4–1 victory over Espanyol, became known in club lore as the partido de la máscara, the final of the mask. A week after suffering a broken cheekbone during a league match, Messi was allowed to start the game on the condition that he wear a plastic protector; soon hindered by the mask, he took it off and scored two goals in 10 minutes before his substitution.[30] At the close of the season, he received an offer to join Arsenal, his first from a foreign club, but while Fàbregas and Piqué soon left for England, he chose to remain in Barcelona.[25][31][32]

Club career
It has been suggested that this section be split out  into another article titled Career of Lionel Messi. (Discuss) (January 2024)
Barcelona
2003–2005: rise to the first team


"It seemed as if he had been playing with us all his life."


– Barcelona's then assistant coach Henk ten Cate on Messi's first-team debut.[33]

During the 2003–04 season Messi rapidly progressed through the club's ranks, debuting for four youth teams in a single campaign.[34] After being named player of the tournament in four international pre-season competitions with the Juveniles B, he was soon promoted to the Juveniles A, where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games.[35][36] Messi was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen Frank Rijkaard's depleted first team during the international break. French winger Ludovic Giuly notes that Messi stood out in first team training sessions: "He destroyed us all... Even the team's starting centre-backs were nervous. He was an alien."[37]
Messi made his first team debut as a 75th-minute substitute during a friendly against Porto on 16 November 2003.[25][38] His performance, creating two chances and a shot on goal, impressed the technical staff, and he subsequently began training daily with the club's reserve side, Barcelona B, as well as weekly with the first team.[39] Barcelona's new star player, Ronaldinho, believed the 16-year-old would become an even better player than himself;[40] he soon befriended Messi, whom he called "little brother", and eased his transition into the first team.[41][42]

Messi playing against Málaga in 2005
To gain further match experience, Messi played for Barcelona C, helping to save them from the relegation zone of the Tercera División by scoring five goals in ten games.[43] He signed his first professional contract, which lasted until 2012 and contained an initial buyout clause of €30 million, on 4 February 2004; this automatically increased to €80 million when he made his debut for Barcelona B on 6 March.[44] He played five games with the B team that season but did not score.[45] Physically weaker than his opponents, who were often much older and taller, he worked on increasing his strength in order to be able to shake off defenders. He finished the campaign with a total of 36 goals in all official competitions.[43]
During the 2004–05 season, Messi was a guaranteed starter for the B team, playing 17 games and scoring on six occasions.[40][46] He was not called up to the first team until the senior players asked manager Frank Rijkaard to promote him in October 2004.[40] Since Ronaldinho already played on the left wing, Rijkaard moved the initially-unwilling Messi onto the right, allowing him to cut into the centre of the pitch and shoot with his dominant left foot.[47][48] He made his league debut as a late substitute against Espanyol on 16 October.[25] At 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition.[42] As a substitute, he played 244 minutes in nine matches for the first team that season, including his debut in the Champions League against Shakhtar Donetsk.[46] He scored his first senior goal on 1 May 2005 against Albacete, becoming – at that time – the youngest-ever scorer for the club.[47][49] That season, Barcelona won the league for the first time in six years.[50]

2005–2008: becoming a starting eleven player


"In my entire life I have never seen a player of such quality and personality at such a young age, particularly wearing the 'heavy' shirt of one of the world's great clubs."


– Fabio Capello praises the 18-year-old Messi following the Joan Gamper trophy in August 2005.[51]

On his 18th birthday, Messi signed his first senior contract, which increased his buyout clause to €150 million and tied him to the club until 2010.[52] On 24 August, during the Joan Gamper Trophy, he started for the first time and gave a well-received performance against Fabio Capello's Juventus, receiving an ovation from the Camp Nou.[51] Capello sought to take Messi to Juventus on loan, but Inter Milan offered to pay his €150 million buyout clause and triple his wages.[53] Messi seriously considered the offer but ultimately decided to stay.[54] On 16 September, his contract was extended to 2014.[52][55]

Messi during a training session with Barcelona in 2006
Due to issues regarding his legal status, Messi missed the start of the 2005–06 La Liga, but on 26 September, he acquired Spanish citizenship and became eligible to play.[55][56] Wearing the number 19 shirt, he gradually established himself as the first-choice right winger, forming an attacking trio with Ronaldinho and striker Samuel Eto'o;[32][57][58] he was in the starting line-up in major matches such as his first Clásico against rivals Real Madrid on 19 November.[59] Messi scored eight goals in twenty-five games, including, against Panathinaikos, his first in the Champions League,[60][61] but suffered a torn hamstring against Chelsea on 7 March 2006. His participation in the Champions League final was ruled out on the day, and he was so disappointed that he refused to celebrate his team's victory over Arsenal in Paris.[57][62]
While Barcelona began a gradual decline, the 19-year-old Messi established himself as one of the best players in the world during the 2006–07 campaign.[63][64] Already an idol to the club's supporters, he scored 17 goals in 36 games across all competitions.[64][65] However, he sustained a metatarsal fracture on 12 November and was injured for three months.[66][67] He recovered in time for the Champions League last 16 round against Liverpool, but Barcelona lost and were knocked out.[68] In the league, 11 of his 14 goals came from his last 13 games;[65] on 10 March 2007, he became the first player in twelve years to score a hat-trick in a Clásico, which ended in a 3–3 draw.[69] His growing importance to the club was reflected that month in a new contract which greatly increased his wages.[70]

Messi making his Maradona-esque run against Getafe in 2007
Already frequently compared to compatriot Diego Maradona, Messi nearly replicated Maradona's two most famous goals in the span of seven weeks.[71] During a Copa del Rey semi-final against Getafe on 18 April, he scored a goal remarkably similar to Maradona's Goal of the Century, by collecting the ball near the halfway line, running 60 metres (66 yd), and beating five defenders before scoring with an angled finish, just as Maradona had done;[21][72] against Espanyol on 9 June, he scored with his hand in similar fashion to Maradona's Hand of God goal.[73] Barcelona faltered that season, failing to reach the Copa del Rey final and losing the league to Real Madrid.[74][75]
After Ronaldinho lost form, Messi became Barça's new star player at only 20 years old, receiving the nickname "Messiah" from the Spanish media.[21][76][77] He was voted the third-best player of the year in the 2007 Ballon d'Or, behind Kaká and runner-up Cristiano Ronaldo, while international managers and national team captains voted him second for the FIFA World Player of the Year award, again behind Kaká.[78][79] Although he managed to score 16 goals during the 2007–08 campaign,[80] the second half of his season was again marred by injuries after he suffered a torn hamstring on 15 December.[81] Returning against Celtic in the Champions League last 16 round, he reinjured himself during the return leg, which Rijkaard had selected him for against the medical staff's wishes; captain Carles Puyol criticised the Spanish media for pressuring Messi to play every match.[81] Barcelona finished the season without trophies, eliminated in the Champions League by Manchester United, and placed third in the league.[82]

2008–10: first treble and Ballon d'Or
After two unsuccessful seasons, Rijkaard and Ronaldinho departed from Barclona. In the latter's wake, Messi was given the number 10 shirt,[58] and signed a new contract with an annual salary of €7.8 million, becoming the club's highest-paid player.[83][84] He and the club implemented strategies to combat his frequent muscular injuries, which ensured he would remain virtually injury-free during the next four years.[67][85] His performances in 2008 saw him again voted runner-up for the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times behind Cristiano Ronaldo.[78][86]

Messi aiming to shoot during the 2009 UEFA Champions League Final against Manchester United
In his first uninterrupted campaign, the 2008–09 season, he scored 38 goals in 51 games.[87][88] Under Barcelona's new manager Pep Guardiola, Messi played mainly on the right wing as a false winger with the freedom to cut inside. During the Clásico on 2 May 2009, he played for the first time as a false nine, positioned as a centre-forward but dropping deep into midfield to link up with Xavi and Andrés Iniesta. He set up his side's first goal and scored twice to end the match in an emphatic 6–2 victory, the team's greatest-ever score at Real Madrid's Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.[89][90] He then scored once and assisted a second goal as Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 4–1 to win the Copa del Rey.[91] With 23 league goals from Messi, Barcelona became La Liga champions.[87][92] The season's Champions League top scorer with nine goals, the youngest in the tournament's history,[93] Messi returned as a false nine for the final on 27 May against Manchester United, in which he scored once; Barcelona won 2–0 and achieved the first treble by a Spanish team.[94] On 18 September, he signed a new contract which increased his salary to €12 million and committed Messi to the club through 2016 with a buyout clause of €250 million.[83]
In the second half of 2009, Barcelona became the first club to achieve the sextuple, winning six top-tier trophies in a single year;[95] after winning the Supercopa de España and UEFA Super Cup in August, Messi scored the winning goal to claim the FIFA Club World Cup on 19 December.[96] At 22 years old, Messi won both the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award by the biggest voting margin in each trophy's history.[78] Unsatisfied with his position on the right wing – with Zlatan Ibrahimović now occupying the central forward role – Messi resumed playing as a false nine in early 2010. He soon effectively became the tactical focal point of Guardiola's team, and his goalscoring rate increased.[97]

– Arsène Wenger commends Messi for his four-goal display against Arsenal in April 2010.[98]

Messi scored a total of 47 goals in all competitions that season, equalling Ronaldo's club record from the 1996–97 campaign.[99][100] He became Barcelona's all-time Champions League top scorer by scoring all four of his side's goals in the quarter-final against Arsenal on 6 April.[101] Although Barcelona were eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by Inter Milan, Messi's eight goals meant he was the competition's top scorer for a consecutive year.[102] As the league's top scorer with 34 goals (again tying Ronaldo's record), he helped Barcelona win a second consecutive La Liga trophy with only a single defeat and earned his first European Golden Shoe.[100][103]

2010–2012: trophies and records
Messi secured Barcelona's first trophy of the 2010–11 campaign, the Supercopa de España, by scoring a hat-trick in his side's second-leg 4–0 victory over Sevilla.[104] He was again instrumental in a Clásico on 29 November 2010 as Barcelona defeated their rivals 5–0.[105] Messi helped the team achieve 16 consecutive league victories, a record in Spanish football, concluding with another hat-trick against Atlético Madrid on 5 February 2011.[106][107] His club performances in 2010 earned him the inaugural FIFA Ballon d'Or, though his win was met with some criticism due to his lack of success with Argentina at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.[78][108] Towards the end of the season, Messi played a prominent role in the Champions League semi-final victory against Real Madrid, scoring two goals, the second of which was highly acclaimed, in the first leg.[109][110][111] Messi gave a man-of-the-match performance in the Champions League final against Manchester United on 28 May, scoring the match-winning goal of Barça's 3–1 victory, and becoming the competition's top scorer for the third consecutive year.[112][113] Barcelona won a third consecutive La Liga title, with Messi scoring 31 and assisting 18 goals.[114][115] He finished the season with 53 goals in all competitions, the highest in Spanish football history.[114][116]

As Messi developed into a combination of a creator and scorer,[117] he scored an unprecedented 73 goals and provided 29 assists in all club competitions during the 2011–12 season, producing a hat-trick or more on 10 occasions.[118][119][120] He began the campaign by helping Barcelona win both the Spanish and European Super Cups, the first with a hat-trick.[121][122] At the close of the year, on 18 December, he scored twice in the FIFA Club World Cup final, a 4–0 victory over Santos.[123] He again received the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming only the fourth player in history to win the Ballon d'Or three times.[124] Additionally, he won the inaugural UEFA Best Player in Europe Award, a revival of the old-style Ballon d'Or.[125] Messi was already widely considered one of the best footballers in history, alongside players like Diego Maradona and Pelé.[26]

Messi pointing to the sky following his record five-goal display against Bayer Leverkusen in the last 16 of the UEFA Champions League in 2012
On 7 March 2012, Messi scored five times in a Champions League last 16-round match against Bayer Leverkusen, an unprecedented achievement in the UEFA Champions League era.[126][127] Two weeks later, on 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona's history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of César Rodríguez's 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada.[128] Barcelona's era of greatness under Guardiola was however drawing to an end.[129] Although Guardiola's Barcelona won their 14th trophy in the Copa del Rey against Athletic Bilbao, the team lost the league to Real Madrid and was eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by Chelsea, with Messi missing a crucial penalty.[130][131] In Barcelona's last home league match on 5 May, Messi scored all four goals before embracing Guardiola, who had announced his resignation as manager.[132] He finished the season as league top scorer in Europe again, with a La Liga record of 50 goals, while his 73 goals in all competitions made him the single-season top scorer in European history.[133][134]
Under manager Tito Vilanova who had first coached him at La Masia, Messi became Barcelona's all-time top scorer in La Liga with 191 goals, and broke the record of most goals scored in a calendar year, previously set by Gerd Müller in 1972.[135] At the close of the year, Messi had scored a record 91 goals in all competitions for Barcelona and Argentina.[136] Messi again won the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming the only player in history to win the Ballon d'Or four times.[136][137]
Barcelona had virtually secured their La Liga title by the start of 2013. However, their performances deteriorated in the second half of the 2012–13 campaign, with Vilanova absent due to ill health.[138] They were nearly eliminated in the Champions League first knockout round by AC Milan, but two goals and an assist from Messi secured a second-leg comeback.[139] Messi signed a new contract on 7 February, committing himself to the club through 2018 with annual wages of €13 million.[140][141] He wore the captain's armband for the first time on 17 March, in a league match against Rayo Vallecano; the team's tactical focal point, more than 40% of Barcelona goals that season involved him, up from 24% three years earlier.[142][143]

After four largely injury-free seasons, the muscular injuries that had previously plagued Messi reoccurred. After he suffered a hamstring strain on 2 April, during the first quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), his appearances became sporadic. In the second leg against PSG, with an underperforming Barcelona down a goal, Messi came off the bench in the second half and within nine minutes helped create their game-tying goal, which allowed them to progress to the semi-finals. Still unfit, he proved ineffective during the first leg against Bayern Munich and was unable to play at all during the second, as Barcelona were defeated 7–0 on aggregate by the eventual champions.[145] These matches gave credence to the notion of Messidependencia, Barcelona's perceived tactical and psychological dependence on their star player.[145]

Messi during a game against Almería in 2014
Messi continued to struggle with injury throughout 2013, eventually parting ways with his long-time personal physiotherapist.[146] Further damage to his hamstring sustained on 12 May ended his goalscoring streak of 21 consecutive league games, a worldwide record; he had netted 33 goals during his run, including a four-goal display against Osasuna, while becoming the first player to score consecutively against all 19 opposition teams in La Liga.[147][148] With 60 goals in all competitions, including 46 goals in La Liga, he finished the campaign as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for the second consecutive year, becoming the first player in history to win the European Golden Shoe three times.[149][150] Following an irregular start to the new season under manager Gerardo Martino, formerly of his boyhood club Newell's Old Boys, Messi suffered his fifth injury of 2013 when he tore his hamstring on 10 November, leaving him sidelined for two months.[151][152] Despite his injuries, he was voted runner-up for the FIFA Ballon d'Or, relinquishing the award after a four-year monopoly to Cristiano Ronaldo.[153]
During the second half of the 2013–14 season, doubts persisted over Messi's form, leading to a perception among the culés that he was reserving himself for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Statistically, his contribution of goals, shots, and passes had dropped significantly compared to previous seasons.[154][155] He still managed to break two longstanding records in a span of seven days: a hat-trick on 16 March against Osasuna saw him overtake Paulino Alcántara's 369 goals to become Barcelona's top goalscorer in all competitions including friendlies, while another hat-trick against Real Madrid on 23 March made him the all-time top scorer in El Clásico, ahead of the 18 goals scored by former Real Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano.[154][156] Messi finished the campaign with his worst output in five seasons, though he still managed to score 41 goals in all competitions.[155][157] For the first time in five years, Barcelona ended the season without a major trophy; they were defeated in the Copa del Rey final by Real Madrid and lost the league in the last game to Atlético Madrid, causing Messi to be booed by sections of fans at the Camp Nou.[158] After prolonged speculation over his future with the club, Messi signed a new contract on 19 May 2014, only a year after his last contractual update; his salary increased to €20 million, or €36 million before taxes, the highest wage in the sport.[159] It was reported that Vilanova played a key role in convincing Messi to stay[160] amid strong interest from José Mourinho's Chelsea.[161]

2014–15: second treble
Messi celebrating his second goal against Granada in 2014
Under new manager and former captain Luis Enrique, Messi experienced a largely injury-free start to the 2014–15 season, allowing him to break three more longstanding records towards the end of the year.[162] A hat-trick scored against Sevilla on 22 November made him the all-time top scorer in La Liga, as he surpassed the 59-year record of 251 league goals held by Telmo Zarra.[163] A third hat-trick, scored against city rivals Espanyol on 7 December, allowed him to surpass César Rodríguez as the all-time top scorer in the Derbi barceloní with 12 goals.[164] Messi again placed second in the FIFA Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo, largely owing to his second-place achievement with Argentina at the World Cup.[165]
At the start of 2015, Barcelona were perceived to be headed for another disappointing end to the season, with renewed speculation in the media that Messi was leaving the club. A turning point came on 11 January during a 3–1 victory over Atlético Madrid, the first time Barça's attacking trident of Messi, Luis Suárez and Neymar, dubbed "MSN", each scored in a match, marking the beginning of a highly successful run.[166][167] After five years of playing in the centre of the pitch, Messi had returned to his old position on the right wing late the previous year, by his own suggestion according to Suárez, their striker.[167][168] From there, he regained his best form, while Suárez and Neymar ended the team's attacking dependency on their star player.[169][170] With 58 goals from Messi, the trio scored a total of 122 goals in all competitions that season, a record in Spanish football.[171]

Towards the end of the campaign, Messi scored in a 1–0 away win over Atlético Madrid on 17 May, securing the La Liga title.[172] Among his 43 league goals that season was a hat-trick scored in 11 minutes against Rayo Vallecano on 8 March, the fastest of his senior career; it was his 32nd hat-trick overall for Barcelona, allowing him to overtake Telmo Zarra with the most hat-tricks in Spanish football.[173] As the season's top assist provider with 18 he surpassed Luís Figo with the most assists in La Liga;[note 4] he made his record 106th assist in a fixture against Levante on 15 February, in which he also scored a hat-trick.[174][175][176] Messi scored twice as Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 3–1 in the Copa del Rey final on 30 May, achieving the sixth double in their history. His opening goal was hailed as one of the greatest in his career; he collected the ball near the halfway line and beat four opposing players, before feinting the goalkeeper to score in a tight space by the near post.[177]
In the Champions League, Messi scored twice and set up another in their 3–0 semi-final victory over Bayern Munich, now under the stewardship of Guardiola.[178] His second goal, which came only three minutes after his first, saw him chip the ball over goalkeeper Manuel Neuer after his dribble past Jérôme Boateng had made the defender drop to the ground; it went viral, becoming the year's most tweeted about sporting moment, and was named the best goal of the season by UEFA.[179][180] Despite a second-leg loss, Barcelona progressed to the final on 6 June in Berlin, where they defeated Juventus 3–1 to win their second treble, becoming the first team in history to do so.[181][182] Although Messi did not score, he participated in each of his side's goals, particularly the second as he forced a parried save from goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon from which Suárez scored the match-winning goal on the rebound.[171] In addition to being the top assist provider with six assists, Messi finished the competition as the joint top scorer with ten goals, which earned him the distinction of being the first player ever to achieve the top scoring mark in five Champions League seasons.[183][184] For his efforts during the season, he received the UEFA Best Player in Europe award for a second time.[185]

Due to his form in the previous season, Messi was not nominated for the Ballon d'Or award for the first time since 2005.[338] On 21 August, Messi provided a long-range assist for Mbappé, clocked at eight seconds, for Ligue 1's second-fastest goal ever scored, before also scoring a goal in 7–1 away win over Lille.[339][340] The following matches, after registering six goal contributions, including one goal and five assists, Messi was named Ligue 1's Player of the Month in September.[341] On 5 October, he scored in a 1–1 draw away to Benfica in the Champions League, becoming the only player in the competition's history to score against 40 different Champions League opponents.[342] On 25 October, he scored twice in a 7–2 Champions League win at home to Maccabi Haifa, setting the record for the most goals scored from outside the 18-yard box than any other player in the competition, with 23 goals.[343] Four days later, Messi scored and provided an assist as PSG won 4–3 against Troyes to remain top of the Ligue 1 table. The goal was his seventh of the league season and his twelfth overall, surpassing his total output of the prior season in just 18 matches.[344]
On 26 February 2023, PSG defeated Marseille 3–0 in Le Classique, with Messi scoring his 700th senior career club goal as well as assisting two goals for Mbappé.[345] On 11 March, PSG defeated Brest 2–1, with Messi setting up a last-minute winner for Mbappé, registering his 300th club career assist.[346] On 8 April, he scored and provided an assist in a 2–0 away win over Nice in Ligue 1, which saw him overtake Cristiano Ronaldo as the all-time highest goalscorer in European club football with 702 goals; during the match, he also achieved 1,000 career direct goal contributions at club level.[347][348] On 2 May, Messi was suspended for two weeks and fined after taking an unauthorised trip to Saudi Arabia with his family as part of a promotional commercial agreement. His visit to Saudi Arabia meant he did not show up to training the previous day following a 3–1 defeat to Lorient.[349] The next day, on 3 May, it was reported that Messi would leave PSG at the end of the season, following the expiry of his contract.[350] Afterwards, several PSG supporters demanded his exit from the club, viewing his absence as evidence of a team not fighting for the shirt, within a context of perceived disconnect between themselves and the club's identity.[351] Two days later, Messi apologised to the club and his teammates for the trip, stating he thought he had a free day after the match [against Lorient], and already had the trip planned, which he had canceled previously.[352] On 28 May, Messi scored in a 1–1 draw against Strasbourg helping PSG clinch their 11th Ligue 1 title and his second in a row; in the process Messi became the player with the most goals in the history of Europe's top five leagues, with 496 goals.[353][354]
On 1 June, Galtier confirmed that PSG's home game against Clermont on 3 June would be Messi's last for the club, with the club confirming his departure two days later;[355] the match ended in 3–2 defeat. He ended the season with the highest number of assists in the league with 16 and was also included in the UNFP's Ligue 1 Team of the Season alongside teammates Achraf Hakimi, Nuno Mendes and Mbappé.[356][357]

Inter Miami
Messi with Inter Miami in the 2023 U.S. Open Cup
Following confirmation of his departure from PSG, Messi was linked with a return to former club Barcelona, as well as with a big-money move to Saudi Professional League club Al-Hilal, but his eventual decision to sign for Major League Soccer club Inter Miami was communicated to Barcelona president Joan Laporta by 5 June 2023.[358][359] Barcelona were unable to sign him due to financial constraints.[360]
On 7 June, Inter Miami posted a video on their social media hinting at the club's impending signing of Messi.[361] On the same day, Messi confirmed his intention to join Miami in a joint interview with Mundo Deportivo and Sport, in which he said that they "haven't closed it 100 percent"; MLS also stated that the deal had not been finalised.[362] He explained that even though La Liga had accepted everything and was fine for him to return to Barcelona, there were many things left to be done such as lowering salaries and selling players, and he did not want to go through it again or be responsible for it.[363] He confirmed that other European clubs approached him, but that Barcelona was the only European team he wanted to play for.[360]
On 15 July 2023, Inter Miami announced the signing of Messi on a two-and-a-half year contract.[364][365] He was formally introduced to fans at a live-streamed event, dubbed "La PresentaSÍon", at DRV PNK Stadium the following day alongside fellow signee and former Barcelona teammate Sergio Busquets.[366] His base salary is set at $12 million with guaranteed compensation totaling $20.4 million for the 2023 season; Messi is also set to earn additional shares from jersey sales, MLS Season Pass subscriptions, and a stake in the club itself.[367]

2023–present: Leagues Cup victory and eighth Ballon d'Or
Messi made his debut for the club on 21 July in a Leagues Cup match against Cruz Azul, scoring with a free-kick in stoppage time for a 2–1 victory.[368] After scoring nine goals in his first six games for Miami, Messi opened the scoring in the 2023 Leagues Cup final against Nashville SC on 19 August before Nashville equalised in the second half. The game ended in a penalty shoot-out which Miami won, 10–9, with Messi scoring the first, giving the club their first ever trophy.[369]
Messi made his MLS debut on 26 August, coming on as a substitute in the 60th minute, scoring a late goal in a 2–0 away win against New York Red Bulls, which put an end to Inter's eleven-match league winless streak.[370] Messi's first goal in the regular season earned him Goal of the Matchday with 89.7% of the vote.[371] On 30 October, following his World Cup win with Argentina and Ligue 1 trophy with PSG, Messi was awarded a record-extending eighth Ballon d'Or.[372] Messi finished his first season for Inter Miami with 11 goals in 14 matches, after playing in his final game in a 1–0 loss to Charlotte FC on 21 October.[373] Miami finished 14th in the Eastern Conference, having gone winless in their last seven games.[374] For his achievements in 2023, he was named Time Athlete of the Year, the first footballer ever to win the award.[375]
On 15 January 2024, Messi won The Best FIFA Men's Player for a record third time.[376] He also extended his record number of appearances in the FIFPRO Men's World 11 to 17 straight appearances, having not missed out on the selection since 2006.[377] On 7 March, Messi and Inter Miami made their debuts in the CONCACAF Champions Cup against Nashville SC.[378] During the match, he scored his first goal in the competition, helping Inter Miami come from behind to earn a 2–2 away draw in the first leg of the round of 16.[379]

Absence in the 2024 Hong Kong exhibition game
  Main article: Lionel Messi's absence in the 2024 Hong Kong exhibition game [zh]
On 4 February 2024, Messi's team Inter Miami played an exhibition match against the Hong Kong League players at the Hong Kong Stadium. However, Messi remained on the bench during the entire match and did not play due to a reported injury, which aroused the anger of the fans at the stadium, who chanted "refund" (Cantonese: 回水).[380] Messi's personal social media accounts were flooded by comments of unsatisfied fans.[381] Legislative Council Member Kenneth Fok issued a statement condemning the organizer Tatler and Inter Miami, believing that both of them were responsible, when the latter received sky-high remuneration, but made the fans leave disappointed and owed them  an apology.[382] The Government of Hong Kong also expressed extreme disappointment at Messi's absence and stated that it was considering revoking the HK$16 million sponsorship funds.[383][384] This incident was dubbed "Messi Messy" by CNN,[385] and translated as "Messi's Chaos" by the Hong Kong media.[386] On 6 February 2024, Messi and his teammates were full of energy when practicing in Japan. Besides passing the ball, Messi was also able to kick the ball into the goal. This left the fans in Hong Kong suspicious that he had not been injured during the aforementioned match.[387] On 8 February 2024, the Chinese Football Association temporarily halted its partnership with the Argentine Football Association over the incident.[388]
A friendly match against Vissel Kobe was held on 7 February 2024. Messi started on the bench, but in the 60th minute of the second half, he came on as a substitute. In the 78th minute, a Messi shot but was saved by the opposing goalkeeper. Although Messi was very active on the pitch, he failed to score. The match ended in a 0–0 draw, and penalties were required to decide the outcome of the encounter. Messi did not participate in the shoot-out, which caused boos from the crow; Inter Miami lost 4–3 in the shoot-out.[389]

International career
It has been suggested that this section be split out  into another article titled Career of Lionel Messi. (Discuss) (January 2024)
2004–2005: success at youth level
As a dual Argentine-Spanish national, Messi was eligible to play for the national team of both countries.[390] Selectors for Spain's Under-17 squad began pursuing him in 2003 after Barcelona's director of football, Carles Rexach, alerted the Royal Spanish Football Federation to their young player. Messi declined the offer, having aspired to represent La Albiceleste since childhood. To further prevent Spain from taking him, the Argentine Football Association organised two under-20 friendlies in June 2004, against Paraguay and Uruguay, with the purpose of finalising his status as an Argentina player in FIFA. Five days after his 17th birthday, on 29 June, he made his debut for his country against Paraguay, scoring once and providing two assists in their 8–0 victory. He was subsequently included in the squad for the South American Youth Championship, held in Colombia in February 2005. As he lacked the stamina of his teammates, the result of his former growth hormone deficiency, he was used as a substitute in six of the nine games. After being named man of the match against Venezuela, he scored the winning 2–1 goal in the crucial last match against Brazil, thereby securing their third-place qualification for the FIFA World Youth Championship.[391]
Aware of his physical limitations, Messi employed a personal trainer to increase his muscle mass, returning to the squad in an improved condition in time for the World Youth Championship, hosted by the Netherlands in June. After he was left out of the starting line-up in their first match against the United States, a 1–0 defeat, the squad's senior players asked manager Francisco Ferraro to let Messi start, as they considered him their best player. After helping the team defeat Egypt and Germany to progress past the group stage, Messi proved decisive in the knockout phase as he scored their equaliser against Colombia, provided a goal and an assist against title favourites Spain, and scored their opening goal against reigning champions Brazil. Ahead of the final, he was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament. He scored two penalties in their 2–1 victory over Nigeria, clinching Argentina's fifth championship and finishing the tournament as top scorer with 6 goals.[392][393] His performances drew comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona, who had led Argentina to the title in 1979.[393]

2005–2006: senior and World Cup debuts
In recognition of his achievements with the under-20 side, senior manager José Pékerman gave Messi his first call-up for a friendly against Hungary on 17 August 2005. Aged 18, Messi made his senior debut for Argentina in the Ferenc Puskás Stadium when he came on in the 63rd minute, only to be sent off after two minutes for a perceived foul against Vilmos Vanczák, who had grabbed his shirt; Messi had struck the defender with his arm while trying to shake him off, which the referee interpreted as an intentional elbowing, a contentious decision.[394] Messi was reportedly found weeping in the dressing room after his sending-off.[395] He returned to the team on 3 September in their World Cup qualifier defeat to Paraguay, which he had declared his "re-debut" ahead of the match.[396] Messi started his first game in the next qualifying match against Peru, in which he was able to win a crucial penalty that secured their victory. After the match, Pékerman described him as "a jewel".[397] He subsequently made regular appearances for the team ahead of Argentina's participation in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, scoring his first goal in a friendly against Croatia on 1 March 2006.[398] A hamstring injury sustained a week later jeopardised his presence in the World Cup, but he was nevertheless selected for Pékerman's squad and regained fitness in time for the start of the tournament.[399]
During the World Cup in Germany, Messi witnessed their opening match victory against the Ivory Coast from the substitutes' bench. In the next match, against Serbia and Montenegro, he became the youngest player to represent Argentina at a FIFA World Cup when he came on as a substitute in the 74th minute. He assisted their fourth strike within minutes and scored the final goal in their 6–0 victory, making him the youngest scorer in the tournament and the sixth-youngest goalscorer in the history of the World Cup.[400] As their progression to the knockout phase was secured, several starters were rested during the last group match. Messi consequently started the game against the Netherlands, a 0–0 draw, as they won their group on goal differential.[401][402] In the round of 16 match against Mexico, played on his 19th birthday, Messi came on in the 84th minute, with the score tied at 1–1. He appeared to score a goal, but it was contentiously ruled offside, with the team needing a late goal in extra time to proceed.[403][404] He did not play in the quarter-final against Germany, during which Argentina were eliminated 4–2 in a penalty shootout.[405] Back home, Pékerman's decision to leave him on the bench against Germany led to widespread criticism from those who believed Messi could have changed the outcome of the match in Argentina's favour.[406][407]

2007–2008: Copa América final and Olympic gold
Messi evades Brazil's Marcelo in the semi-final of the 2008 Summer Olympics
As Messi evolved into one of the best players in the world, he secured a place in Alfio Basile's starting line-up, as part of a team considered favourites to win the 2007 Copa América, held in Venezuela.[64][408] He set up the game-winning goal of their 4–1 victory over the United States in the opening match, before winning a penalty that led to the game-tying first strike of their 4–2 win in the next match against Colombia.[409][410] At the quarter-final stage, where the group winners faced Peru, he scored the second goal of a 4–0 victory that saw them through to the semi-final, during which he chipped the ball over Mexico's goalkeeper to ensure another 3–0 win.[408] In a surprise defeat, Argentina lost the final 3–0 to a Brazil squad that lacked several of the nation's best players.[411] Their unexpected loss was followed by much criticism in Argentina, though Messi was mostly exempt due to his young age and secondary status to star player Juan Román Riquelme.[408] He was named the best young player of the tournament by CONMEBOL.[412]
Ahead of the 2008 Summer Olympics, Barcelona legally barred Messi from representing Argentina at the tournament as it coincided with their Champions League qualifying matches.[413] After interference from newly appointed Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola, who had won the tournament in 1992, Messi was permitted to join Sergio Batista's under-23 squad in Beijing.[414] During the first match, he scored the opening goal in their 2–1 victory over the Ivory Coast. Following a 1–0 win in the next group match against Australia, ensuring their quarter-final qualification, Messi was rested during the game against Serbia, while his side won the match to finish first in their group. Against the Netherlands, he again scored the first goal and assisted a second strike to help his team to a 2–1 win in extra time. After a 3–0 semi-final victory over Brazil, Messi assisted the only goal in the final as Argentina defeated Nigeria to claim Olympic gold medals.[415] Along with Riquelme, Messi was singled out by FIFA as the stand-out player from the tournament's best team.[416]

2008–2011: collective decline
From late 2008, the national team experienced a three-year period marked by poor performances.[408] Under manager Diego Maradona, who had led Argentina to World Cup victory as a player, the team struggled to qualify for the 2010 World Cup, securing their place in the tournament only after defeating Uruguay 1–0 in their last qualifying match. Maradona was criticised for his strategic decisions, which included playing Messi out of his usual position. In eight qualifying matches under Maradona's stewardship, Messi scored only one goal, netting the opening goal in the first such match, a 4–0 victory over Venezuela.[398][417] During that game, played on 28 March 2009, he wore Argentina's number 10 shirt for the first time, following the international retirement of Riquelme.[418] Overall, Messi scored four goals in 18 appearances during the qualifying process.[398] Ahead of the tournament, Maradona visited Messi in Barcelona to request his tactical input; Messi then outlined a 4–3–1–2 formation with himself playing behind the two strikers, a playmaking position known as the enganche in Argentine football, which had been his preferred position since childhood.[419]

Messi in action during the opening match against Bolivia at the 2011 Copa América
Despite their poor qualifying campaign, Argentina were considered title contenders at the World Cup in South Africa. At the start of the tournament, the new formation proved effective; Messi managed at least four attempts on goal during their opening match but was repeatedly denied by Nigeria's goalkeeper, resulting in a 1–0 win. During the next match, against South Korea, he excelled in his playmaking role, participating in all four goals of his side's 4–1 victory. As their place in the knockout phase was guaranteed, most of the starters were rested during the last group match, but Messi reportedly refused to be benched.[417] He wore the captain's armband for the first time in their 2–0 win against Greece; as the focal point of their play, he helped create their second goal to see Argentina finish as group winners.[420]
Argentina were eliminated in the quarter-final against Germany, at the same stage of the tournament and by the same opponent as four years earlier. Their 4–0 loss was their worst margin of defeat at a World Cup since 1974.[421] FIFA subsequently identified Messi as one of the tournament's 10 best players, citing his "outstanding" pace and creativity and "spectacular and efficient" dribbling, shooting and passing.[422] Back home, however, Messi was the subject of harsher judgement. As the perceived best player in the world, he had been expected to lead an average team to the title, as Maradona arguably did in 1986, but he had failed to replicate his performances at Barcelona with the national team, leading to the accusation that he cared less about his country than his club.[423]
Maradona was replaced by Sergio Batista, who had orchestrated Argentina's Olympic victory. Batista publicly stated that he intended to build the team around Messi, employing him as a false nine within a 4–3–3 system, as used to much success by Barcelona.[423][424] Although Messi scored a record 53 goals during the 2010–11 club season, he had not scored for Argentina in an official match since March 2009.[114][398] Despite the tactical change, his goal drought continued during the 2011 Copa América, hosted by Argentina. Their first two matches, against Bolivia and Colombia, ended in draws. Media and fans noted that he did not combine well with striker Carlos Tevez, who enjoyed greater popularity among the Argentine public; Messi was consequently booed by his own team's supporters for the first time in his career. During the crucial next match, with Tevez on the bench, he gave a well-received performance, assisting two goals in their 3–0 victory over Costa Rica. After the quarter-final against Uruguay ended in a 1–1 draw following extra time, with Messi having assisted their equaliser, Argentina were eliminated 4–5 in the penalty shootout by the eventual champions.[423]

2011–2013: assuming the captaincy
Messi scored his first international hat-trick against Switzerland in 2012.
After Argentina's unsuccessful performance in the Copa América, Batista was replaced by Alejandro Sabella. Upon his appointment in August 2011, Sabella awarded the 24-year-old Messi the captaincy of the squad, in accord with then-captain Javier Mascherano. Reserved by nature, Messi went on to lead his squad by example as their best player, while Mascherano continued to fulfil the role of the team's on-field leader and motivator.[425][426] In a further redesign of the team, Sabella dismissed Tevez and brought in players with whom Messi had won the World Youth Championship and Olympic Games. Now playing in a free role in an improving team, Messi ended his goal drought by scoring during their first World Cup qualifying match against Chile on 7 October, his first official goal for Argentina in two-and-a-half years.[398][425]
Under Sabella, Messi's goalscoring rate drastically increased; where he had scored only 17 goals in 61 matches under his previous managers, he scored 25 times in 32 appearances during the following three years.[398][425] He netted a total of 12 goals in 9 games for Argentina in 2012, equalling the record held by Gabriel Batistuta for the most goals scored in a calendar year for their country.[427] His first international hat-trick came in a friendly against Switzerland on 29 February 2012, followed by two more hat-tricks over the next year-and-a-half in friendlies against Brazil and Guatemala. Messi then helped the team secure their place in the 2014 World Cup with a 5–2 victory over Paraguay on 10 September 2013 when he scored twice from penalty kicks, taking his international tally to 37 goals to become Argentina's second-highest goalscorer behind Batistuta. Overall, he had scored a total of 10 goals in 14 matches during the qualifying campaign.[398][428] Concurrently with his bettered performances, his relationship with his compatriots improved, as he gradually began to be perceived more favourably in Argentina.[425]

2014–2015: World Cup and Copa América finals
Messi watches his 25-yard curling strike hit the net against Iran to win the game for Argentina in their second group game at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
Ahead of the World Cup in Brazil, doubts persisted over Messi's form, as he finished an unsuccessful and injury-plagued season with Barcelona. At the start of the tournament, however, he gave strong performances, being elected man of the match in their first four matches.[429] In his first World Cup match as captain, he led them to a 2–1 victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina; he helped create Sead Kolašinac's own goal and scored their second strike after a dribble past three players, his first World Cup goal since his debut in the tournament eight years earlier.[430] During the second match against Iran, he scored an injury-time goal from 25 yards out to end the game in a 1–0 win, securing their qualification for the knockout phase.[431] He scored twice in the last group match, a 3–2 victory over Nigeria, his second goal coming from a free kick, as they finished first in their group.[432] Messi assisted a late goal in extra time to ensure a 1–0 win against Switzerland in the round of 16, and played in the 1–0 quarter-final win against Belgium as Argentina progressed to the semi-final of the World Cup for the first time since 1990.[433][434] Following a 0–0 draw in extra time, they eliminated the Netherlands 4–2 in a penalty shootout to reach the final, with Messi scoring his team's first penalty.[435]

Messi battles Germany's Mats Hummels for the ball during the 2014 FIFA World Cup final.
Billed as Messi versus Germany, the world's best player against the best team, the final was a repeat of the 1990 final featuring Diego Maradona.[436] Within the first half-hour, Messi had started the play that led to a goal, but it was ruled offside. He missed several opportunities to open the scoring throughout the match, in particular at the start of the second half when his breakaway effort went wide of the far post. Substitute Mario Götze finally scored in the 113th minute, followed in the last minute of extra time by a free kick that Messi sent over the net, as Germany won the match 1–0 to claim the World Cup.[437] At the conclusion of the final, Messi was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament. In addition to being the joint third-highest goalscorer, with four goals and an assist, he created the most chances, completed the most dribbling runs, made the most deliveries into the penalty area and produced the most throughballs in the competition.[429][438] However, his selection drew criticism due to his lack of goals in the knockout round; FIFA President Sepp Blatter expressed his surprise, while Maradona suggested that Messi had undeservedly been chosen for marketing purposes.[439]
Another final appearance, the third of Messi's senior international career, followed in the 2015 Copa América, held in Chile. Under the stewardship of former Barcelona manager Gerardo Martino, Argentina entered the tournament as title contenders due to their second-place achievement at the World Cup.[440][441] During the opening match against Paraguay, they were ahead two goals by half-time but lost their lead to end the match in a 2–2 draw; Messi had scored from a penalty kick, netting his only goal in the tournament.[442] Following a 1–0 win against defending champions Uruguay, Messi earned his 100th cap for his country in the final group match, a 1–0 win over Jamaica, becoming only the fifth Argentine to achieve this milestone.[443] In his 100 appearances, he had scored a total of 46 goals for Argentina, 22 of which came in official competitive matches.[398][443]
As Messi evolved from the team's symbolic captain into a genuine leader, he led Argentina to the knockout stage as group winners.[444] In the quarter-final, they created numerous chances, including a rebound header by Messi, but were repeatedly denied by Colombia's goalkeeper, and ultimately ended the match scoreless, leading to a 5–4 penalty shootout in their favour, with Messi netting his team's first spot kick.[445] At the semi-final stage, Messi excelled as a playmaker as he provided three assists and helped create three more goals in his side's 6–1 victory over Paraguay, receiving applause from the initially hostile crowd.[444] Argentina started the final as the odds-on title favourites, but were defeated by Chile 4–1 in a penalty shootout after a 0–0 extra-time draw. Faced with aggression from opposing players, including taking a boot to the midriff, Messi played below his standards, though he was the only Argentine to successfully convert his penalty.[446] At the close of the tournament, he was reportedly selected to receive the Most Valuable Player award but rejected the honour.[447] As Argentina continued a trophy drought that began in 1993, the World Cup and Copa América defeats again brought intense criticism for Messi from Argentine media and fans.[448]

2016–2017: third Copa América final, first retirement, and return
Messi's place in Argentina's Copa América Centenario squad was initially put in jeopardy when he sustained a back injury in a 1–0 friendly win over Honduras in a pre-Copa América warm-up match on 27 May 2016.[449] It was later reported that he had suffered a deep bruise in his lumbar region. He was later left on the bench in Argentina's 2–1 opening win over defending champions Chile on 6 June due to concerns regarding his fitness.[450] Although Messi was declared match-fit for his nation's second group match against Panama on 10 June, Martino left him on the bench once again; he replaced Augusto Fernández in the 61st minute and subsequently scored a hat-trick in 19 minutes, also starting the play which led to Sergio Agüero's goal, as the match ended in a 5–0 victory, sealing Argentina's place in the quarter-finals of the competition;[451] he was elected man of the match for his performance.[452]



"Did it annoy me that Messi took the record? A little, yes. You go around the world and people say, 'he's the top scorer for the Argentina national team.' But the advantage I have is that I'm second to an extraterrestrial."


– Gabriel Batistuta on the consolation of Messi breaking his record.[453]

On 18 June, in the quarter-final of the Copa América against Venezuela, Messi produced another man of the match performance,[454] assisting two goals and scoring another in a 4–1 victory, which enabled him to equal Gabriel Batistuta's national record of 54 goals in official international matches.[455] This record was broken three days later when Messi scored a free kick in a 4–0 semi-final win against hosts the United States; he also assisted two goals during the match as Argentina sealed a place in the final of the competition for a second consecutive year,[456] and was named man of the match once again.[457]
During a repeat of the previous year's final on 26 June, Argentina once again lost to Chile on penalties after a 0–0 deadlock, resulting in Messi's third consecutive defeat in a major tournament final with Argentina, and his fourth overall. After the match, Messi, who had missed his penalty in the shootout, announced his retirement from international football.[458] He stated, "I tried my hardest. The team has ended for me, a decision made."[459] Chile coach Juan Antonio Pizzi said after the match, "My generation can't compare him to Maradona that's for my generation, because of what Maradona did for Argentine football. But I think the best player ever played today here in the United States."[460] Messi finished the tournament as the second highest scorer, behind Eduardo Vargas, with five goals, and was the highest assist provider with four assists, also winning more Man of the Match awards than any other player in the tournament (3);[461] he was named to the team of the tournament for his performances, but missed out on the Golden Ball Award for best player, which went to Alexis Sánchez.[462]
Following his announcement, a campaign began in Argentina for Messi to change his mind about retiring.[463] He was greeted by fans with signs like "Don't go, Leo" when the team landed in Buenos Aires. President of Argentina Mauricio Macri urged Messi not to quit, stating, "We are lucky, it is one of life's pleasures, it is a gift from God to have the best player in the world in a footballing country like ours... Lionel Messi is the greatest thing we have in Argentina and we must take care of him."[464] Mayor of Buenos Aires Horacio Rodríguez Larreta unveiled a statue of Messi in the capital to convince him to reconsider retirement.[465] The campaign also continued in the streets and avenues of the Argentine capital, with about 50,000 supporters going to the Obelisco de Buenos Aires on 2 July, using the same slogan.[466]



"A lot of things went through my mind on the night of the final and I gave serious thought to quitting, but my love for my country and this shirt is too great."


– Messi reversing his decision from retiring on 12 August 2016[467]

Just a week after Messi announced his international retirement, Argentine newspaper La Nación reported that he was reconsidering playing for Argentina at the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in September.[468] On 12 August, it was confirmed that Messi had reversed his decision to retire from international football, and he was included in the squad for the national team's upcoming 2018 World Cup qualifiers.[469] On 1 September, in his first game back, he scored in a 1–0 home win over Uruguay in a 2018 World Cup qualifier.[470]

On 28 March 2017, Messi was suspended for four international games for insulting an assistant referee in a game against Chile on 23 March 2017. He was also fined CHF 10,000.[471][472] On 5 May, Messi's four match ban as well as his 10,000 CHF fine was lifted by FIFA after Argentina Football Association appealed against his suspension, which meant he could now play Argentina's remaining World Cup Qualifiers.[473] Argentina's place in the 2018 World Cup was in jeopardy going into their final qualifying match as they were sixth in their group, outside the five possible CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying spots, meaning they risked failing to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1970. On 10 October, Messi led his country to World Cup qualification in scoring a hat-trick as Argentina came from behind to defeat Ecuador 3–1 away; Argentina had not defeated Ecuador in Quito since 2001.[474] Messi's three goals saw him become the joint all-time leading scorer in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers with 21 goals, alongside Uruguay's Luis Suárez, overtaking the previous record which was held by compatriot Hernán Crespo.[474]

Following on from their poor qualification campaign, expectations were not high going into the 2018 World Cup, with the team, without an injured Messi, losing 6–1 to Spain in March 2018.[476][477] Prior to Argentina's opener, there was speculation in the media over whether this would be Messi's final World Cup.[478] In the team's opening group match against Iceland on 16 June, Messi missed a potential match-winning penalty in an eventual 1–1 draw.[479] In Argentina's second game on 21 June, the team lost 3–0 to Croatia in a huge upset. Post-match the Argentina coach Jorge Sampaoli spoke of the lack of quality in the team surrounding Messi, saying "we quite simply couldn't pass to him to help him generate the situations he is used to. We worked to give him the ball but the opponent also worked hard to prevent him from getting the ball. We lost that battle".[480] Croatia captain and midfielder Luka Modrić also stated post match, "Messi is an incredible player but he can't do everything alone."[481]

Messi celebrates his goal against Nigeria at the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
In Argentina's final group match against Nigeria at the Krestovsky Stadium, Saint Petersburg on 26 June, Messi scored the opening goal in an eventual 2–1 victory, becoming the third Argentine after Diego Maradona and Gabriel Batistuta to score in three different World Cups; he also became the first player to score in the World Cup in his teens, twenties, and his thirties.[482] A goal of the tournament contender, Messi received a long pass from midfield and controlled the ball on the run with two touches before striking it across goal into the net with his weaker right foot.[483][484] He was awarded Man of the Match.[485] Argentina progressed to the second round as group runners-up behind Croatia.[486] In the round of 16 match against eventual champions France on 30 June, Messi set up Gabriel Mercado's and Sergio Agüero's goals in a 3–4 defeat, which saw Argentina eliminated from the World Cup.[487] With his two assists in his team's second round fixture, Messi became the first player to provide an assist in the last four World Cups, and also became the first player to provide two assists in a match for Argentina since Maradona had managed the same feat against South Korea in 1986.[488][489]
Following the tournament, Messi stated that he would not participate in Argentina's friendlies against Guatemala and Colombia in September, and commented that it would be unlikely that he would represent his nation for the remainder of the calendar year. Messi's absence from the national team and his continued failure to win a title with Argentina prompted speculation in the media that Messi might retire from international football once again.[490] In March 2019, however, he was called up to the Argentina squad once again for the team's friendlies against Venezuela and Morocco later that month.[491] A conversation with Lionel Scaloni and his idol Pablo Aimar made Messi reconsider his decision to retire.[492] He made his international return on 22 March, in a 3–1 friendly defeat to Venezuela, in Madrid.[493]

2019–2020: Copa América third-place and suspension
On 21 May, Messi was included in Scaloni's final 23-man squad for the 2019 Copa América.[494] In Argentina's second group match on 19 June, Messi scored the equalising goal from the penalty spot in a 1–1 draw against Paraguay.[495] After coming under criticism in the media over his performance following Argentina's 2–0 quarter-final victory over Venezuela on 28 June, Messi commented that it had not been his best Copa América, while also criticising the poor quality of the pitches.[496] Following Argentina's 2–0 semi-final defeat to hosts Brazil on 2 July, Messi was critical of the refereeing,[497][498] and alleged the competition was "set up" for Brazil to win.[499]
In the third-place match against Chile on 6 July, Messi set-up Agüero's opening goal from a free kick in an eventual 2–1 win, to help Argentina win the bronze medal; however, he was sent off along with Gary Medel in the 37th minute of play, after being involved in an altercation with the Chilean defender.[500] Following the match, Messi refused to collect his medal, and implied in a post-match interview that his comments following the semi-final led to his sending off.[501] Messi later issued an apology for his comments, but was fined $1,500 and was handed a one-match ban by CONMEBOL, which ruled him out of Argentina's next World Cup qualifier.[502] On 2 August, Messi was banned for three months from international football and was fined $50,000 by CONMEBOL for his comments against the referee's decisions; this ban meant he would miss Argentina's friendly matches against Chile, Mexico and Germany in September and October.[503] On 15 November, Messi played in the 2019 Superclásico de las Américas versus Brazil, scoring the winning goal by a rebound of his saved penalty.[504] On 8 October 2020, Messi scored a penalty in a 1–0 victory against Ecuador, giving Argentina a winning start to their 2022 World Cup qualifying campaign.[505]

On 14 June 2021, Messi scored from a free kick in a 1–1 draw against Chile in Argentina's opening group match of the 2021 Copa América in Brazil.[507] On 21 June, Messi played in his 147th match as he equalled Javier Mascherano's record for most appearances for Argentina in a 1–0 win over Paraguay in their third game of the tournament.[508] A week later, he broke the record when he featured in a 4–1 win against Bolivia in his team's final group match, assisting Papu Gómez's opening goal and later scoring two.[509] On 3 July, Messi assisted twice and scored from a free-kick in a 3–0 win over Ecuador in the quarter-finals of the competition.[510] On 6 July, in a 1–1 draw in the semi-finals against Colombia, Messi made his 150th appearance for his country and registered his fifth assist of the tournament, a cut-back for Lautaro Martínez, matching his record of nine goal contributions in a single tournament from five years earlier; he later scored his spot kick in Argentina's eventual 3–2 penalty shoot-out victory to progress to his fifth international final.[511][512] On 10 July, Argentina defeated hosts and defending champions Brazil 1–0 in the final, giving Messi his first major international title and Argentina's first since 1993, as well as his nation's joint record 15th Copa América overall.[513][514] Messi was directly involved in nine out of the 12 goals scored by Argentina, scoring four and assisting five; he was named the player of the tournament for his performances, an honour he shared with Neymar. He also finished as top scorer with four goals tied with Colombia's Luis Díaz, with the Golden Boot awarded to Messi as he had more assists.[515][516]
On 9 September, Messi scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 home win over Bolivia in a 2022 World Cup qualifier which also moved him above Pelé as South America's top male international scorer with 79 goals.[517] In the 2022 Finalissima, the third edition of the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions, at Wembley on 2 June 2022, Messi assisted twice in a 3–0 victory against Italy and was named player of the match, securing his second trophy for Argentina at the senior level.[518] Messi then followed this on 6 June with all five Argentina goals in a 5–0 victory in a friendly win over Estonia, overtaking Ferenc Puskás among the all-time international men's top scorers.[519]

Messi at the 2022 FIFA World Cup
At the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, Messi scored a penalty in Argentina's opening game, a 2–1 defeat to Saudi Arabia, before scoring with a low 20-yard strike in their next match against Mexico in which Argentina won 2–0, also recording an assist on Enzo Fernández's goal.[520] In the last 16 game against Australia, Messi scored the opening goal in Argentina's 2–1 win in what was his 1,000th senior career appearance,[521] and became the most-capped male South American (CONMEBOL member) footballer of all time, surpassing the previous record set by Ecuador's Iván Hurtado, as well as surpassing and equalling several other FIFA World Cup and national team records.[522][523] In the quarter-final against the Netherlands, Messi assisted Argentina's first goal for Nahuel Molina with a reverse pass and then scored a penalty as the game finished 2–2 after extra time. Argentina won 4–3 in the penalty shootout, with Messi scoring the first penalty.[524] In the semi-final against Croatia, Messi made a record-equalling 25th World Cup finals appearance, drawing level with Germany's Lothar Matthäus, and scored the opening goal with a penalty before he assisted Argentina's third goal scored by Julián Álvarez in a 3–0 win;[525] with his 11th World Cup goal, Messi overtook Batistuta to become Argentina's all-time top-scorer at the World Cup.[526] Argentina advanced to the final against France, with Messi stating that it would be his final World Cup appearance.[527][528]
In the 2022 FIFA World Cup final on 18 December, Messi made his record 26th World Cup match appearance at Lusail Stadium. He scored Argentina's opening goal with a penalty, becoming in the process the first player since the last-16 round was introduced in 1986 to score a goal in every round of a single World Cup edition.[529][530] After Argentina's eventual two-goal lead was erased by France forward Kylian Mbappé, who scored twice inside two minutes, Messi would score again in extra-time to restore Argentina's lead, before Mbappé again drew France level. Tied 3–3 after extra-time, the match went to a penalty shoot-out. Messi scored Argentina's first goal in the shoot-out, with Argentina eventually winning 4–2, ending the nation's 36-year wait for the trophy.[531] Messi received the Golden Ball for player of the tournament, becoming the first player to win it twice. He finished second in the Golden Boot race with seven goals in seven games, one behind Mbappé.[530] With his appearance and two goals in the final, Messi overtook Matthaüs as the player with most appearances at the World Cup (26), and Pelé as the player with most direct goal contributions at the World Cup (21 – 13 goals and 8 assists).[532] The championship game was widely acclaimed as one of the best of all time, with media coverage heavily framing it as a duel between Messi and Mbappé.[533][534][535][536] Following the game, Messi confirmed that he had no plans to retire from the national team, saying "I want to continue playing as a champion".[537] In December 2023, a set of jerseys he had worn during the World Cup was sold at auction for 7.8 million dollars.[538]

2023–present: 100 international goals
In March 2023, Messi made his return to Argentina as a world champion with two appearances in friendlies in his home country. He scored his 99th international goal with a free-kick in Argentina's 2–0 win over Panama; this also marked his 800th senior career goal for club and country.[539] In the following match against Curaçao, Messi scored a hat-trick, his ninth for Argentina, and recorded an assist in a 7–0 win. The first of his three goals saw him reach 100 international goals, making Messi the third player in history to reach the milestone.[540]

Player profile
Style of play
A versatile forward, Messi often plays as a classic number 10.
Due to his short stature, Messi has a lower centre of gravity than taller players, which gives him greater agility, allowing him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles;[541][542] this has led the Spanish media to dub him La Pulga Atómica ("The Atomic Flea").[543][544][545] Despite being physically unimposing, he possesses significant upper-body strength, which, combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance, aids him in withstanding physical challenges from opponents; he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with playacting.[18][542][546] His short, strong legs allow him to excel in short bursts of acceleration while his quick feet enable him to retain control of the ball when dribbling at speed.[547] His former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola once stated, "Messi is the only player that runs faster with the ball than he does without it."[48] Although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot since his mid-20s, Messi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists.[548][549]
A prolific goalscorer, Messi is known for his finishing, positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line. He also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and range of passing.[550] He has often been described as a magician; a conjurer, creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist.[551][552][553] Moreover, he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker.[542][554] As of September 2023, Messi ranks 5th all time in goals scored from direct free kicks with 65,[555] the most among active players.[556] He also has a penchant for scoring from chips.[557]

Messi is known to drop deep, link-up with midfielders, orchestrate attacking plays, and create goal-scoring opportunities.
Messi's pace and technical ability enable him to undertake individual dribbling runs towards goal, in particular during counterattacks, usually starting from the halfway line or the right side of the pitch.[546][554][558] Widely considered to be the best dribbler in the world,[559] and one of the greatest dribblers of all time,[560] with regard to this ability, his former Argentina manager Diego Maradona has said of him, "The ball stays glued to his foot; I've seen great players in my career, but I've never seen anyone with Messi's ball control."[549] Beyond his individual qualities, he is also a well-rounded, hard-working team player, known for his creative combinations, in particular with former Barcelona midfielders Xavi and Andrés Iniesta.[541][542]
Tactically, Messi plays in a free attacking role; a versatile player, he is capable of attacking on either wing or through the centre of the pitch. His favoured position in childhood was the playmaker behind two strikers, known as the enganche in Argentine football, but he began his career in Spain as a left-winger or left-sided forward.[419] Upon his first-team debut, he was moved onto the right wing by manager Frank Rijkaard; from this position, he could more easily cut through the defence into the middle of the pitch and curl shots on goal with his left foot, rather than predominantly cross balls for teammates.[48] Under Guardiola and subsequent managers, he most often played in a false nine role; positioned as a centre-forward or lone striker, he would roam the centre, often moving deep into midfield and drawing defenders with him, in order to create and exploit spaces for passes, other teammates' attacking runs off the ball, Messi's own dribbling runs, or combinations with Xavi and Iniesta.[26] Under the stewardship of Luis Enrique, Messi initially returned to playing in the right-sided position that characterised much of his early career in the manager's 4–3–3 formation,[168][561] while he was increasingly deployed in a deeper, free playmaking role in later seasons.[562][563] Under manager Ernesto Valverde, Messi played in a variety of roles. While he occasionally continued to be deployed in a deeper role, from which he could make runs from behind into the box,[564] or even on the right wing[565] or as a false nine,[566][567] he was also used in a more offensive, central role in a 4–2–3–1,[563] or as a second striker in a 4–4–2 formation, where he was once again given the licence to drop deep, link-up with midfielders, orchestrate his team's attacking plays, and create chances for his attacking partner Suárez.[568][569]

Messi prepares to shoot with his dominant left foot in the 2014 FIFA World Cup final.
As his career advanced, and his tendency to dribble diminished slightly with age, Messi began to dictate play in deeper areas of the pitch and developed into one of the best passers and playmakers in football history.[570][571][572] His work-rate off the ball and defensive responsibilities also decreased as his career progressed; by covering less ground on the pitch, and instead conserving his energy for short bursts of speed, he was able to improve his efficiency, movement, and positional play, and was also able to avoid muscular injuries, despite often playing a large number of matches throughout a particular season on a consistent basis. Indeed, while he was injury-prone in his early career, he was later able to improve his injury record by running less off the ball, and by adopting a stricter diet, training regime, and sleep schedule.[573] With the Argentina national team, Messi has similarly played anywhere along the frontline; under various managers, he has been employed on the right wing, as a false nine, as an out-and-out striker, in a supporting role alongside another forward, or in a deeper, free creative role as a classic number 10 playmaker or attacking midfielder behind the strikers.[424][574]

Reception and comparisons to Diego Maradona
Main article: New Maradona


"I have seen the player who will inherit my place in Argentinian football and his name is Messi."


– Diego Maradona hailing the 18-year-old Messi as his successor in February 2006[71]

A prodigious talent as a teenager, Messi established himself among the world's best players before age 20.[64] Diego Maradona considered the 18-year-old Messi the best player in the world alongside Ronaldinho, while the Brazilian himself, shortly after winning the 2005 Ballon d'Or, commented, "I'm not even the best at Barça", in reference to his protégé.[575][576] Four years later, after Messi had won his first Ballon d'Or by a record margin,[78] the public debate regarding his qualities as a player moved beyond his status in contemporary football to the possibility that he was one of the greatest players in history.[14][546][577] An early proponent was his then-manager Pep Guardiola, who, as early as August 2009, declared Messi to be the best player he had ever seen.[578] In the following years, this opinion gained greater acceptance among pundits, managers, former and current players,[116][579] and by the end of Barça's second treble-winning season, the view of Messi as one of the greatest footballers of all time had become the apparent view among many fans and pundits in continental Europe.[580][581] He initially received several dismissals by critics, based on the fact that he had not won an international trophy at senior level with Argentina,[582] until he won his first at the 2021 Copa América.[583]

Throughout his career, Messi has been compared with his late compatriot Diego Maradona, due to their similar playing styles as diminutive, left-footed dribblers. Initially, he was merely one of many young Argentine players, including his boyhood idol Pablo Aimar, to receive the "New Maradona" moniker, but as his career progressed, Messi proved his similarity beyond all previous contenders, establishing himself as the greatest player Argentina had produced since Maradona.[22][417] Jorge Valdano, who won the 1986 World Cup alongside Maradona, said in October 2013, "Messi is Maradona every day. For the last five years, Messi has been the Maradona of the World Cup in Mexico."[584] César Menotti, who as manager orchestrated their 1978 World Cup victory, echoed this sentiment when he opined that Messi plays "at the level of the best Maradona".[585] Other notable Argentines in the sport, such as Osvaldo Ardiles, Javier Zanetti, and Diego Simeone, have expressed their belief that Messi has overtaken Maradona as the best player in history.[586][587][588]
In Argentine society, prior to 2019, Messi was generally held in lesser esteem than Maradona, a consequence of not only his perceived uneven performances with the national team, but also of differences in class, personality, and background. Messi is in some ways the antithesis of his predecessor: where Maradona was an extroverted, controversial character who rose to greatness from the slums, Messi is reserved and unassuming, an unremarkable man outside of football.[390][589][590] An enduring mark against him is the fact that, through no fault of his own, he never proved himself in the Argentine Primera División as an upcoming player, achieving stardom overseas from a young age,[18][390] while his lack of outward passion for the Albiceleste shirt (until 2019 he did not sing the national anthem and is disinclined to emotional displays) have in the past led to the false perception that he felt Catalan rather than truly Argentine.[423] Football journalist Tim Vickery states the view among Argentines is that Messi "was always seen as more Catalan than one of them".[591] Despite having lived in Spain since age 13, Messi rejected the option of representing Spain internationally. He has said: "Argentina is my country, my family, my way of expressing myself. I would change all my records to make the people in my country happy."[592] Moreover, several pundits and footballing figures, including Maradona, questioned Messi's leadership with Argentina at times, despite his playing ability.[593][594][595] Vickery states the perception of Messi among Argentines changed in 2019, with Messi making a conscious effort to become "more one of the group, more Argentine", with Vickery adding that following the World Cup victory in 2022 Messi would now be held in the same esteem by his compatriots as Maradona.[591]

Comparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo
Main article: Messi–Ronaldo rivalry
Messi has been compared with Cristiano Ronaldo (left) throughout much of their careers.
Among his contemporary peers, Messi is most often compared and contrasted with Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo, as part of an ongoing rivalry that has been compared to past sports rivalries like the Muhammad Ali–Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Roger Federer–Rafael Nadal rivalry in tennis, and the Prost–Senna rivalry from Formula One motor racing.[596][597]
Although Messi has at times denied any rivalry,[598][599] they are widely believed to push one another in their aim to be the best player in the world.[154] Since 2008, Messi has won eight Ballons d'Or to Ronaldo's five,[600] seven FIFA World's Best Player awards to Ronaldo's five, and six European Golden Shoes to Ronaldo's four.[601] Pundits and fans regularly argue the individual merits of both players.[154][602] Beyond their playing styles, the debate also revolves around their differing physiques – Ronaldo is 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1⁄2 in) with a muscular build – and contrasting public personalities with Ronaldo's self-confidence and theatrics a foil to Messi's humility.[603][604][605] From 2009–10 to 2017–18, Messi faced Ronaldo at least twice every season in El Clásico, which ranks among the world's most viewed annual sports events.[606] Off the pitch, Ronaldo is his direct competitor in terms of salary, sponsorships, and social media fanbase.[606]
After Messi led Argentina to victory in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a number of football critics, commentators, and players have opined that Messi has settled the debate between the two players.[A]

In popular culture
Messi was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014; he was the first player to exceed the €40 million benchmark, with earnings of €41 million in 2013, and the €50–€60 million points, with income of €65 million in 2014.[159][610] Messi was second on Forbes list of the world's highest-paid athletes, after Ronaldo, with income of $81 million from salary and endorsements in 2015–16.[611] In 2018 he was the first player to exceed the €100m benchmark for a calendar year, with earnings of €126m ($154m) in combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements.[612] Forbes ranked him the world's highest-paid athlete in 2019.[613] From 2008, he was Barcelona's highest-paid player, receiving a salary that increased incrementally from €7.8 million to €13 million over the next five years.[83][84][140] Signing a new contract in 2017, he earned $667,000 per week in wages, and Barcelona paid him $60 million as a signing on bonus.[614] His buyout clause was set at $835 million (€700 million).[614] In 2020, Messi became the second footballer, as well as the second athlete in a team sport, after Ronaldo, to surpass $1 billion in earnings during their careers.[615]

Messi's Argentina jersey, supplied by Adidas, was sold out worldwide during the 2022 World Cup.[616]
In addition to salary and bonuses, much of his income derives from endorsements; SportsPro has consequently cited him as one of the world's most marketable athletes every year since their research began in 2010.[617] His main sponsor since 2006 is Adidas. As Barcelona's leading youth prospect, he was signed with Nike since age 14, but transferred to Adidas after they successfully challenged their rival's claim to his image rights in court.[618] Messi established himself as their leading brand endorser;[606] from 2008, he had a long-running signature collection of Adidas F50 boots, and in 2015, became the first footballer to receive his own sub-brand of Adidas boots, the Adidas Messi.[619][620] Since 2017, he has worn the latest version of the Adidas Nemeziz.[621] In 2015, a Barcelona jersey with Messi's name and number was the best-selling replica jersey worldwide.[622] At the 2022 World Cup, Adidas sold out of Messi's Argentina No.10 jersey worldwide.[616]

After blessing himself, Messi often celebrates a goal by pointing a finger on each hand towards the sky in dedication to his late grandmother.[623] His goal celebration features in the FIFA video game series, first appearing in FIFA 14.
As a commercial entity, Messi's brand has been based exclusively on his talents and achievements as a player, in contrast to arguably more glamorous players like Ronaldo and David Beckham. At the start of his career, he thus mainly held sponsorship contracts with companies that employ sports-oriented marketing, such as Adidas, Pepsi, and Konami.[624][625] From 2010, concurrently with increased achievements as a player, his marketing appeal widened, leading to long-term endorsement deals with luxury brands Dolce & Gabbana and Audemars Piguet.[624][626] Messi is a global brand ambassador for Gillette, Turkish Airlines, Ooredoo, and Tata Motors, among other companies.[627][628][629][630] Messi was the face of Konami's video game series Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of PES 2009, PES 2010, PES 2011 and PES 2020. He subsequently signed with rival company EA Sports to become the face of their series FIFA and appeared on consecutive covers from FIFA 13 to FIFA 16.[631][632]
Messi was among the Time 100, an annual list of the world's most influential people, in 2011, 2012 and 2023.[633][634][635] His fanbase on Facebook is among the largest of public figures: within seven hours of its launch in April 2011, Messi's Facebook page had nearly seven million followers, and by July 2023 he had over 114 million followers, the second highest for a sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo.[636][637] He has over 450 million Instagram followers, the second highest for an individual and sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo.[638] His World Cup celebration post from 18 December 2022 is the most liked post on Instagram with over 70 million likes.[639] According to a 2014 survey in 15 international markets, Messi was familiar to 87% of respondents around the world, of whom 78% perceived him favourably, making him the second-most recognised player globally, behind Ronaldo, and the most likable of all contemporary players.[640][641] On his economic impact on the city in which he plays, Terry Gibson called him a "tourist attraction".[642]

Indian vehicle art of Messi
Madame Tussauds unveiled their first wax sculpture of Messi at Wembley Stadium in 2012.[643] A gold replica of his left foot, weighing 25 kg (55 lb) and valued at $5.3 million, went on sale in Japan in 2013 to raise funds for victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.[644] In 2013, a Turkish Airlines advertisement starring Messi, in which he engages in a selfie competition with Kobe Bryant, was the most-watched ad on YouTube in 2013, receiving 137 million views, and was voted the best advertisement of the 2005–15 decade to commemorate YouTube's founding.[645][646] World Press Photo selected "The Final Game", a photo of Messi facing the World Cup trophy after Argentina's final defeat to Germany, as the best sports image of 2014.[647] Messi, a documentary by filmmaker Álex de la Iglesia, premiered at the Venice Film Festival in August 2014.[648]
In June 2021, Messi signed a five-year deal to become an ambassador for the Hard Rock Cafe brand. He stated, "sports and music are an integral part of my life. It is an honor to be the first athlete to partner with a brand who has a history of teaming with music legends."[649] In May 2022, Messi was unveiled as Saudi Arabia's tourism ambassador. Due to Saudi Arabia's poor human rights record, Messi was condemned the role which was viewed as an attempt of Saudi sportswashing.[650][651] In April 2023, Messi was featured in the 200 year old Thrissur Pooram festival in Kerala, India.[652] During Thrissur Pooram, which is one of the largest festivals in Asia, umbrellas carrying the illuminated cut outs of Messi holding the World Cup trophy were displayed on the top of caparisoned elephants during the Kudamattam ceremony.[653]

Personal life
Family and relationships
Since 2008, Messi has been in a relationship with Antonela Roccuzzo, a fellow native of Rosario.[654] He has known Roccuzzo since he was five years old, as she is the cousin of his childhood best friend, Lucas Scaglia, who is also a football player.[655] After keeping their relationship private for a year, Messi first confirmed their romance in an interview in January 2009, before going public a month later during a carnival in Sitges after the Barcelona–Espanyol derby.[656]



"Leo is not shy. He's introverted. He's reserved."


— Endocrinologist Diego Schwarzstein,[note 5] who addressed Messi's growth hormone deficiency from 1997 to 2001.

Messi and Roccuzzo have three sons. To celebrate his partner's first pregnancy, Messi placed the ball under his shirt after scoring in Argentina's 4–0 win against Ecuador on 2 June 2012, before confirming the pregnancy in an interview two weeks later.[658] Thiago was born in Barcelona on 2 November 2012.[659] In April 2015, Messi confirmed that they were expecting another child.[660] On 30 June 2017, he married Roccuzzo at a luxury hotel named Hotel City Center in Rosario.[661] In October 2017, his wife announced they were expecting their third child.[662] Messi and his family are Catholic Christians.[663]
Messi enjoys a close relationship with his immediate family members, particularly his mother, Celia, whose face he has tattooed on his left shoulder. His professional affairs are largely run as a family business: his father, Jorge, has been his agent since he was 14, and his oldest brother, Rodrigo, handles his daily schedule and publicity. His mother and other brother, Matías, manage his charitable organization, the Leo Messi Foundation, and take care of personal and professional matters in Rosario.[664]
Since leaving for Spain aged 13, Messi has maintained close ties to his hometown of Rosario, even preserving his distinct Rosarino accent. He has kept ownership of his family's old house, although it has long stood empty; he maintains a penthouse apartment in an exclusive residential building for his mother, as well as a family compound just outside the city. Once when he was in training with the national team in Buenos Aires, he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and returned to Buenos Aires the next day in time for practice. Messi keeps in daily contact via phone and text with a small group of confidants in Rosario, most of whom were fellow members of "The Machine of '87" at Newell's Old Boys. While at Barcelona he lived in Castelldefels, a village near Barcelona. He was on bad terms with the club after his transfer to Barcelona, but by 2012 their public feud had ended, with Newell's embracing their ties with Messi, even issuing a club membership card to his newborn son.[18][665][666] Messi has long planned to return to Rosario to end his playing career at Newell's.[667] Messi holds triple citizenship, as he is a citizen of Argentina, Italy, and Spain.[668]

Philanthropy
Throughout his career, Messi has been involved in charitable efforts aimed at vulnerable children, a commitment that stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his own childhood. Since 2004, he has contributed his time and finances to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), an organisation with which Barcelona also have a strong association.[669][670] Messi has served as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador since his appointment in March 2010, completing his first field mission for the organisation four months later as he travelled to Haiti to bring public awareness to the plight of the country's children in the wake of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. He has since participated in UNICEF campaigns targeting HIV prevention, education, and the social inclusion of disabled children.[671] To celebrate his son's first birthday, in November 2013, Messi and Thiago were part of a publicity campaign to raise awareness of mortality rates among disadvantaged children.[672]

Messi (pictured in 2007) has worked with UNICEF since 2004 and has served as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador since 2010.
In addition to his work with UNICEF, Messi founded his own charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, which supports access to health care, education, and sport for children.[673] It was established in 2007 following a visit Messi paid to a hospital for terminally ill children in Boston, an experience that resonated with him to the point that he decided to reinvest part of his earnings into society.[665] Through his foundation, Messi has awarded research grants, financed medical training, and invested in the development of medical centres and projects in Argentina, Spain, and elsewhere in the world.[665][674] In addition to his own fundraising activities, such as his global "Messi and Friends" football matches, his foundation receives financial support from various companies to which he has assigned his name in endorsement agreements, with Adidas as their main sponsor.[675][676]
Messi has also invested in youth football in Argentina: he financially supports Sarmiento, a football club based in the Rosario neighbourhood where he was born, committing in 2013 to the refurbishment of their facilities and the installation of all-weather pitches, and funds the management of several youth players at Newell's Old Boys and rival club Rosario Central, as well as at River Plate and Boca Juniors in Buenos Aires.[665] At Newell's Old Boys, his boyhood club, he funded the 2012 construction of a new gymnasium and a dormitory inside the club's stadium for their youth academy. His former youth coach at Newell's, Ernesto Vecchio, is employed by the Leo Messi Foundation as a talent scout for young players.[18] On 7 June 2016, Messi won a libel case against La Razón newspaper and was awarded €65,000 in damages, which he donated to the charity Médecins Sans Frontières.[677] Messi made a donation worth €1 million ($1.1 million) to fight the spread of coronavirus.[678] This was split between Clinic Barcelona hospital in Barcelona, Spain and his native Argentina.[679] In addition to this, Messi along with his fellow FC Barcelona teammates announced he will be taking a 70% cut in salaries during the 2020 coronavirus emergency, and contribute further to the club to provide fully to salaries of all the clubs employees.[680]
In November 2016, with the Argentine Football Association being run by a FIFA committee for emergency due to an economic crisis, it was reported that three of the national team's security staff told Messi that they had not received their salaries for six months. He stepped in and paid the salaries of the three members.[681][682] In February 2021, Messi donated to the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya his Adidas shoes which he wore when he scored his 644th goal for Barcelona and broke Pelé's record for most goals scored for a single club; the shoes were later auctioned off in April by the museum for charity to help children with cancer and were sold for £125,000.[683]
In advance of the 2021 Copa América in Uruguay, Messi donated three signed shirts to the Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech—whose directors spoke of their admiration for Messi—in order to secure 50,000 doses of Sinovac's COVID-19 vaccine, CoronaVac, in the hope of vaccinating all of South America's football players.[684] A deal brokered by Uruguay's president Luis Lacalle Pou, the plan to prioritise football players caused some controversy given widespread vaccine scarcity in the region, with the Mayor of Canelones Yamandú Orsi remarking that "Just as the president manifested cooperation with CONMEBOL to vaccinate for the Copa América, he could just as well have the same consideration for Canelones".[684]

Tax fraud
Messi's financial affairs came under investigation in 2013 for suspected tax evasion. Offshore companies in tax havens Uruguay and Belize were used to evade €4.1 million in taxes related to sponsorship earnings between 2007 and 2009. An unrelated shell company in Panama set up in 2012 was subsequently identified as belonging to the Messis in the Panama Papers data leak. Messi, who pleaded ignorance of the alleged scheme, voluntarily paid arrears of €5.1 million in August 2013. On 6 July 2016, Messi and his father were both found guilty of tax fraud and were handed suspended 21-month prison sentences and respectively ordered to pay €1.7 million and €1.4 million in fines.[685] Facing the judge, he said, "I just played football. I signed the contracts because I trusted my dad and the lawyers and we had decided that they would take charge of those things."[686]

^ According to FCBarcelona.com, and his authorised biography, Messi by Guillem Balagué, his surname is the single "Messi", in accordance with Argentine customs.[2][3] Other sources, including a 2014 document by FIFA, give his surname as the double "Messi Cuccittini".[4] After winning a libel case in 2017, Messi's own management company stated: "The football player Lionel Andres Messi Cuccittini has donated a total of €72,783.20 to the organisation Doctors Without Borders."[5]

^ Messi received France Football's 2009 Ballon d'Or and FIFA's 2009 FIFA World Player of the Year award, prior to their six-year merger; he proceeded to win the newly formed award, the FIFA Ballon d'Or, four times—2010, 2011, 2012, 2015. Both organisations credited him with five (FIFA) Ballon d'Or awards.[6][7] He then went on to win the Ballon d'Or three more times—2019, 2021, 2023—again assigned by the sole France Football, and won the newly established The Best FIFA Men's Player three times as well—2019, 2022, 2023. France Football recognizes him as a record eight-time Ballon d'Or winner and FIFA recognizes him as a record eight-time world's best player.[8][9]

^ a b Messi missed the 2006 UEFA Champions League final through injury, but received a winners medal having been part of the Barcelona squad for the 2005–06 Champions League season.[10] The official UEFA website states "several other players have four titles to their name but only three final appearances: Lionel Messi: 2006*, 2009, 2011, 2015 (Barcelona)".[11]

^ Assist statistics began in 1990.

^ According to Bleacher Report's Richard Fitzpatrick, "Schwarzstein and Messi built up a close relationship during more than four years of treatment."[657]



^ a b Does not include an unofficial friendly match played on 24 May 2008 in Barcelona between Argentina U23 and the Catalonia national football team,[697][698] as Catalonia is not affiliated with either FIFA or UEFA as a national member association and is therefore not allowed to participate in official competitions.[699]

Lionel Andrés "Leo" Messi[note 1] (Spanish pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes ˈmesi] ⓘ; born 24 June 1987) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Major League Soccer club Inter Miami and the Argentina national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record eight Ballon d'Or awards, a record six European Golden Shoes, and was named the world's best player for a record eight times by FIFA.[note 2] Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles, and the UEFA Champions League four times.[note 3] With his country, he won the 2021 Copa América and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals in La Liga (474), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions League (eight), and most assists in La Liga (192) and the Copa América (17). He also has the most international goals by a South American male (106). Messi has scored over 800 senior career goals for club and country, and has the most goals by a player for a single club (672).
Messi relocated to Spain from Argentina aged 13 to join Barcelona, for whom he made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning four consecutive Ballons d'Or, making him the first player to win the award four times. During the 2011–12 season, he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived career rival), before regaining his best form during the 2014–15 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and won a record sixth Ballon d'Or in 2019. Out of contract, he signed for French club Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021, spending two seasons at the club and winning Ligue 1 twice. Messi joined American club Inter Miami in July 2023, winning the Leagues Cup in August of that year.
An Argentine international, Messi is the country's all-time leading goalscorer and also holds the national record for appearances. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, finishing the tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with his compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup (2006), and reached the final of the 2007 Copa América, where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, for which he won the Golden Ball, the 2015 Copa América, winning the Golden Ball, and the 2016 Copa América. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a third-place finish at the 2019 Copa América, and victory in the 2021 Copa América, while winning the Golden Ball and Golden Boot for the latter. That same year, Messi received a seventh Ballon d'Or. In 2022, he led Argentina to win the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where he won a record second Golden Ball, scored seven goals including two in the final, and broke the record for most games played at the World Cup (26), later receiving his record-extending eighth Ballon d'Or in 2023.
Messi has endorsed sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2019 and 2022. Messi was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, 2012, and 2023. In 2020 and 2023, he was named the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year, with Messi being the first team-sport athlete to win the award. In 2020, Messi was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team and became the second footballer and second team-sport athlete to surpass $1 billion in career earnings.


Early life
Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe,[12] the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the north-central Adriatic Marche region of Italy, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry.[3] Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, "Leo" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers.[13] At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches.[14] He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Roman Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother.[15][16]



"When you saw him you would think: this kid can't play ball. He's a dwarf, he's too fragile, too small. But immediately you'd realise that he was born different, that he was a phenomenon and that he was going to be something impressive."


– Newell's Old Boys youth coach Adrián Coria shares his first impression of the 12-year-old Messi.[17]

A lifelong supporter of Newell's Old Boys, Messi joined the Rosario club when he was six years old. During the six years he played for Newell's, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of "The Machine of '87", the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of the first team's home games.[18][19] However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, aged 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. As his father's health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone treatment, which cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise.[20] He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker Pablo Aimar he idolised.[21][22] It was speculated that he failed to be signed into River Plate due to his ill health, however in a 2019 interview, Messi revealed that the club had offered to pay for his medical treatment despite ultimately rejecting him.[23] His goalscoring idol growing up was Brazilian striker Ronaldo, with Messi calling him "the best forward I've ever seen".[24]

Messi enrolled at Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, aged 13.
As the Messi family had relatives in Catalonia, they sought to arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000. First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin.[21][25] In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister, María Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.[18][25][26]
After a year at Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, Messi was finally enrolled in the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) in February 2002. Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were Cesc Fàbregas and Gerard Piqué.[27] After completing his growth hormone treatment aged 14,[28] Messi became an integral part of the "Baby Dream Team", Barcelona's greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (2002–03), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the Cadetes A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups.[27][29] The Copa Catalunya final, a 4–1 victory over Espanyol, became known in club lore as the partido de la máscara, the final of the mask. A week after suffering a broken cheekbone during a league match, Messi was allowed to start the game on the condition that he wear a plastic protector; soon hindered by the mask, he took it off and scored two goals in 10 minutes before his substitution.[30] At the close of the season, he received an offer to join Arsenal, his first from a foreign club, but while Fàbregas and Piqué soon left for England, he chose to remain in Barcelona.[25][31][32]

Barcelona
2003–2005: rise to the first team


"It seemed as if he had been playing with us all his life."


– Barcelona's then assistant coach Henk ten Cate on Messi's first-team debut.[33]

During the 2003–04 season Messi rapidly progressed through the club's ranks, debuting for four youth teams in a single campaign.[34] After being named player of the tournament in four international pre-season competitions with the Juveniles B, he was soon promoted to the Juveniles A, where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games.[35][36] Messi was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen Frank Rijkaard's depleted first team during the international break. French winger Ludovic Giuly notes that Messi stood out in first team training sessions: "He destroyed us all... Even the team's starting centre-backs were nervous. He was an alien."[37]
Messi made his first team debut as a 75th-minute substitute during a friendly against Porto on 16 November 2003.[25][38] His performance, creating two chances and a shot on goal, impressed the technical staff, and he subsequently began training daily with the club's reserve side, Barcelona B, as well as weekly with the first team.[39] Barcelona's new star player, Ronaldinho, believed the 16-year-old would become an even better player than himself;[40] he soon befriended Messi, whom he called "little brother", and eased his transition into the first team.[41][42]

Messi playing against Málaga in 2005
To gain further match experience, Messi played for Barcelona C, helping to save them from the relegation zone of the Tercera División by scoring five goals in ten games.[43] He signed his first professional contract, which lasted until 2012 and contained an initial buyout clause of €30 million, on 4 February 2004; this automatically increased to €80 million when he made his debut for Barcelona B on 6 March.[44] He played five games with the B team that season but did not score.[45] Physically weaker than his opponents, who were often much older and taller, he worked on increasing his strength in order to be able to shake off defenders. He finished the campaign with a total of 36 goals in all official competitions.[43]
During the 2004–05 season, Messi was a guaranteed starter for the B team, playing 17 games and scoring on six occasions.[40][46] He was not called up to the first team until the senior players asked manager Frank Rijkaard to promote him in October 2004.[40] Since Ronaldinho already played on the left wing, Rijkaard moved the initially-unwilling Messi onto the right, allowing him to cut into the centre of the pitch and shoot with his dominant left foot.[47][48] He made his league debut as a late substitute against Espanyol on 16 October.[25] At 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition.[42] As a substitute, he played 244 minutes in nine matches for the first team that season, including his debut in the Champions League against Shakhtar Donetsk.[46] He scored his first senior goal on 1 May 2005 against Albacete, becoming – at that time – the youngest-ever scorer for the club.[47][49] That season, Barcelona won the league for the first time in six years.[50]

– Fabio Capello praises the 18-year-old Messi following the Joan Gamper trophy in August 2005.[51]

On his 18th birthday, Messi signed his first senior contract, which increased his buyout clause to €150 million and tied him to the club until 2010.[52] On 24 August, during the Joan Gamper Trophy, he started for the first time and gave a well-received performance against Fabio Capello's Juventus, receiving an ovation from the Camp Nou.[51] Capello sought to take Messi to Juventus on loan, but Inter Milan offered to pay his €150 million buyout clause and triple his wages.[53] Messi seriously considered the offer but ultimately decided to stay.[54] On 16 September, his contract was extended to 2014.[52][55]

Messi during a training session with Barcelona in 2006
Due to issues regarding his legal status, Messi missed the start of the 2005–06 La Liga, but on 26 September, he acquired Spanish citizenship and became eligible to play.[55][56] Wearing the number 19 shirt, he gradually established himself as the first-choice right winger, forming an attacking trio with Ronaldinho and striker Samuel Eto'o;[32][57][58] he was in the starting line-up in major matches such as his first Clásico against rivals Real Madrid on 19 November.[59] Messi scored eight goals in twenty-five games, including, against Panathinaikos, his first in the Champions League,[60][61] but suffered a torn hamstring against Chelsea on 7 March 2006. His participation in the Champions League final was ruled out on the day, and he was so disappointed that he refused to celebrate his team's victory over Arsenal in Paris.[57][62]
While Barcelona began a gradual decline, the 19-year-old Messi established himself as one of the best players in the world during the 2006–07 campaign.[63][64] Already an idol to the club's supporters, he scored 17 goals in 36 games across all competitions.[64][65] However, he sustained a metatarsal fracture on 12 November and was injured for three months.[66][67] He recovered in time for the Champions League last 16 round against Liverpool, but Barcelona lost and were knocked out.[68] In the league, 11 of his 14 goals came from his last 13 games;[65] on 10 March 2007, he became the first player in twelve years to score a hat-trick in a Clásico, which ended in a 3–3 draw.[69] His growing importance to the club was reflected that month in a new contract which greatly increased his wages.[70]

Messi making his Maradona-esque run against Getafe in 2007
Already frequently compared to compatriot Diego Maradona, Messi nearly replicated Maradona's two most famous goals in the span of seven weeks.[71] During a Copa del Rey semi-final against Getafe on 18 April, he scored a goal remarkably similar to Maradona's Goal of the Century, by collecting the ball near the halfway line, running 60 metres (66 yd), and beating five defenders before scoring with an angled finish, just as Maradona had done;[21][72] against Espanyol on 9 June, he scored with his hand in similar fashion to Maradona's Hand of God goal.[73] Barcelona faltered that season, failing to reach the Copa del Rey final and losing the league to Real Madrid.[74][75]
After Ronaldinho lost form, Messi became Barça's new star player at only 20 years old, receiving the nickname "Messiah" from the Spanish media.[21][76][77] He was voted the third-best player of the year in the 2007 Ballon d'Or, behind Kaká and runner-up Cristiano Ronaldo, while international managers and national team captains voted him second for the FIFA World Player of the Year award, again behind Kaká.[78][79] Although he managed to score 16 goals during the 2007–08 campaign,[80] the second half of his season was again marred by injuries after he suffered a torn hamstring on 15 December.[81] Returning against Celtic in the Champions League last 16 round, he reinjured himself during the return leg, which Rijkaard had selected him for against the medical staff's wishes; captain Carles Puyol criticised the Spanish media for pressuring Messi to play every match.[81] Barcelona finished the season without trophies, eliminated in the Champions League by Manchester United, and placed third in the league.[82]

2008–10: first treble and Ballon d'Or
After two unsuccessful seasons, Rijkaard and Ronaldinho departed from Barclona. In the latter's wake, Messi was given the number 10 shirt,[58] and signed a new contract with an annual salary of €7.8 million, becoming the club's highest-paid player.[83][84] He and the club implemented strategies to combat his frequent muscular injuries, which ensured he would remain virtually injury-free during the next four years.[67][85] His performances in 2008 saw him again voted runner-up for the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times behind Cristiano Ronaldo.[78][86]

Messi aiming to shoot during the 2009 UEFA Champions League Final against Manchester United
In his first uninterrupted campaign, the 2008–09 season, he scored 38 goals in 51 games.[87][88] Under Barcelona's new manager Pep Guardiola, Messi played mainly on the right wing as a false winger with the freedom to cut inside. During the Clásico on 2 May 2009, he played for the first time as a false nine, positioned as a centre-forward but dropping deep into midfield to link up with Xavi and Andrés Iniesta. He set up his side's first goal and scored twice to end the match in an emphatic 6–2 victory, the team's greatest-ever score at Real Madrid's Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.[89][90] He then scored once and assisted a second goal as Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 4–1 to win the Copa del Rey.[91] With 23 league goals from Messi, Barcelona became La Liga champions.[87][92] The season's Champions League top scorer with nine goals, the youngest in the tournament's history,[93] Messi returned as a false nine for the final on 27 May against Manchester United, in which he scored once; Barcelona won 2–0 and achieved the first treble by a Spanish team.[94] On 18 September, he signed a new contract which increased his salary to €12 million and committed Messi to the club through 2016 with a buyout clause of €250 million.[83]
In the second half of 2009, Barcelona became the first club to achieve the sextuple, winning six top-tier trophies in a single year;[95] after winning the Supercopa de España and UEFA Super Cup in August, Messi scored the winning goal to claim the FIFA Club World Cup on 19 December.[96] At 22 years old, Messi won both the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award by the biggest voting margin in each trophy's history.[78] Unsatisfied with his position on the right wing – with Zlatan Ibrahimović now occupying the central forward role – Messi resumed playing as a false nine in early 2010. He soon effectively became the tactical focal point of Guardiola's team, and his goalscoring rate increased.[97]

– Arsène Wenger commends Messi for his four-goal display against Arsenal in April 2010.[98]

Messi scored a total of 47 goals in all competitions that season, equalling Ronaldo's club record from the 1996–97 campaign.[99][100] He became Barcelona's all-time Champions League top scorer by scoring all four of his side's goals in the quarter-final against Arsenal on 6 April.[101] Although Barcelona were eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by Inter Milan, Messi's eight goals meant he was the competition's top scorer for a consecutive year.[102] As the league's top scorer with 34 goals (again tying Ronaldo's record), he helped Barcelona win a second consecutive La Liga trophy with only a single defeat and earned his first European Golden Shoe.[100][103]

2010–2012: trophies and records
Messi secured Barcelona's first trophy of the 2010–11 campaign, the Supercopa de España, by scoring a hat-trick in his side's second-leg 4–0 victory over Sevilla.[104] He was again instrumental in a Clásico on 29 November 2010 as Barcelona defeated their rivals 5–0.[105] Messi helped the team achieve 16 consecutive league victories, a record in Spanish football, concluding with another hat-trick against Atlético Madrid on 5 February 2011.[106][107] His club performances in 2010 earned him the inaugural FIFA Ballon d'Or, though his win was met with some criticism due to his lack of success with Argentina at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.[78][108] Towards the end of the season, Messi played a prominent role in the Champions League semi-final victory against Real Madrid, scoring two goals, the second of which was highly acclaimed, in the first leg.[109][110][111] Messi gave a man-of-the-match performance in the Champions League final against Manchester United on 28 May, scoring the match-winning goal of Barça's 3–1 victory, and becoming the competition's top scorer for the third consecutive year.[112][113] Barcelona won a third consecutive La Liga title, with Messi scoring 31 and assisting 18 goals.[114][115] He finished the season with 53 goals in all competitions, the highest in Spanish football history.[114][116]

As Messi developed into a combination of a creator and scorer,[117] he scored an unprecedented 73 goals and provided 29 assists in all club competitions during the 2011–12 season, producing a hat-trick or more on 10 occasions.[118][119][120] He began the campaign by helping Barcelona win both the Spanish and European Super Cups, the first with a hat-trick.[121][122] At the close of the year, on 18 December, he scored twice in the FIFA Club World Cup final, a 4–0 victory over Santos.[123] He again received the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming only the fourth player in history to win the Ballon d'Or three times.[124] Additionally, he won the inaugural UEFA Best Player in Europe Award, a revival of the old-style Ballon d'Or.[125] Messi was already widely considered one of the best footballers in history, alongside players like Diego Maradona and Pelé.[26]

Messi pointing to the sky following his record five-goal display against Bayer Leverkusen in the last 16 of the UEFA Champions League in 2012
On 7 March 2012, Messi scored five times in a Champions League last 16-round match against Bayer Leverkusen, an unprecedented achievement in the UEFA Champions League era.[126][127] Two weeks later, on 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona's history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of César Rodríguez's 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada.[128] Barcelona's era of greatness under Guardiola was however drawing to an end.[129] Although Guardiola's Barcelona won their 14th trophy in the Copa del Rey against Athletic Bilbao, the team lost the league to Real Madrid and was eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by Chelsea, with Messi missing a crucial penalty.[130][131] In Barcelona's last home league match on 5 May, Messi scored all four goals before embracing Guardiola, who had announced his resignation as manager.[132] He finished the season as league top scorer in Europe again, with a La Liga record of 50 goals, while his 73 goals in all competitions made him the single-season top scorer in European history.[133][134]
Under manager Tito Vilanova who had first coached him at La Masia, Messi became Barcelona's all-time top scorer in La Liga with 191 goals, and broke the record of most goals scored in a calendar year, previously set by Gerd Müller in 1972.[135] At the close of the year, Messi had scored a record 91 goals in all competitions for Barcelona and Argentina.[136] Messi again won the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming the only player in history to win the Ballon d'Or four times.[136][137]
Barcelona had virtually secured their La Liga title by the start of 2013. However, their performances deteriorated in the second half of the 2012–13 campaign, with Vilanova absent due to ill health.[138] They were nearly eliminated in the Champions League first knockout round by AC Milan, but two goals and an assist from Messi secured a second-leg comeback.[139] Messi signed a new contract on 7 February, committing himself to the club through 2018 with annual wages of €13 million.[140][141] He wore the captain's armband for the first time on 17 March, in a league match against Rayo Vallecano; the team's tactical focal point, more than 40% of Barcelona goals that season involved him, up from 24% three years earlier.[142][143]

After four largely injury-free seasons, the muscular injuries that had previously plagued Messi reoccurred. After he suffered a hamstring strain on 2 April, during the first quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), his appearances became sporadic. In the second leg against PSG, with an underperforming Barcelona down a goal, Messi came off the bench in the second half and within nine minutes helped create their game-tying goal, which allowed them to progress to the semi-finals. Still unfit, he proved ineffective during the first leg against Bayern Munich and was unable to play at all during the second, as Barcelona were defeated 7–0 on aggregate by the eventual champions.[145] These matches gave credence to the notion of Messidependencia, Barcelona's perceived tactical and psychological dependence on their star player.[145]

Messi continued to struggle with injury throughout 2013, eventually parting ways with his long-time personal physiotherapist.[146] Further damage to his hamstring sustained on 12 May ended his goalscoring streak of 21 consecutive league games, a worldwide record; he had netted 33 goals during his run, including a four-goal display against Osasuna, while becoming the first player to score consecutively against all 19 opposition teams in La Liga.[147][148] With 60 goals in all competitions, including 46 goals in La Liga, he finished the campaign as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for the second consecutive year, becoming the first player in history to win the European Golden Shoe three times.[149][150] Following an irregular start to the new season under manager Gerardo Martino, formerly of his boyhood club Newell's Old Boys, Messi suffered his fifth injury of 2013 when he tore his hamstring on 10 November, leaving him sidelined for two months.[151][152] Despite his injuries, he was voted runner-up for the FIFA Ballon d'Or, relinquishing the award after a four-year monopoly to Cristiano Ronaldo.[153]
During the second half of the 2013–14 season, doubts persisted over Messi's form, leading to a perception among the culés that he was reserving himself for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Statistically, his contribution of goals, shots, and passes had dropped significantly compared to previous seasons.[154][155] He still managed to break two longstanding records in a span of seven days: a hat-trick on 16 March against Osasuna saw him overtake Paulino Alcántara's 369 goals to become Barcelona's top goalscorer in all competitions including friendlies, while another hat-trick against Real Madrid on 23 March made him the all-time top scorer in El Clásico, ahead of the 18 goals scored by former Real Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano.[154][156] Messi finished the campaign with his worst output in five seasons, though he still managed to score 41 goals in all competitions.[155][157] For the first time in five years, Barcelona ended the season without a major trophy; they were defeated in the Copa del Rey final by Real Madrid and lost the league in the last game to Atlético Madrid, causing Messi to be booed by sections of fans at the Camp Nou.[158] After prolonged speculation over his future with the club, Messi signed a new contract on 19 May 2014, only a year after his last contractual update; his salary increased to €20 million, or €36 million before taxes, the highest wage in the sport.[159] It was reported that Vilanova played a key role in convincing Messi to stay[160] amid strong interest from José Mourinho's Chelsea.[161]

2014–15: second treble
Messi celebrating his second goal against Granada in 2014
Under new manager and former captain Luis Enrique, Messi experienced a largely injury-free start to the 2014–15 season, allowing him to break three more longstanding records towards the end of the year.[162] A hat-trick scored against Sevilla on 22 November made him the all-time top scorer in La Liga, as he surpassed the 59-year record of 251 league goals held by Telmo Zarra.[163] A third hat-trick, scored against city rivals Espanyol on 7 December, allowed him to surpass César Rodríguez as the all-time top scorer in the Derbi barceloní with 12 goals.[164] Messi again placed second in the FIFA Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo, largely owing to his second-place achievement with Argentina at the World Cup.[165]
At the start of 2015, Barcelona were perceived to be headed for another disappointing end to the season, with renewed speculation in the media that Messi was leaving the club. A turning point came on 11 January during a 3–1 victory over Atlético Madrid, the first time Barça's attacking trident of Messi, Luis Suárez and Neymar, dubbed "MSN", each scored in a match, marking the beginning of a highly successful run.[166][167] After five years of playing in the centre of the pitch, Messi had returned to his old position on the right wing late the previous year, by his own suggestion according to Suárez, their striker.[167][168] From there, he regained his best form, while Suárez and Neymar ended the team's attacking dependency on their star player.[169][170] With 58 goals from Messi, the trio scored a total of 122 goals in all competitions that season, a record in Spanish football.[171]

Towards the end of the campaign, Messi scored in a 1–0 away win over Atlético Madrid on 17 May, securing the La Liga title.[172] Among his 43 league goals that season was a hat-trick scored in 11 minutes against Rayo Vallecano on 8 March, the fastest of his senior career; it was his 32nd hat-trick overall for Barcelona, allowing him to overtake Telmo Zarra with the most hat-tricks in Spanish football.[173] As the season's top assist provider with 18 he surpassed Luís Figo with the most assists in La Liga;[note 4] he made his record 106th assist in a fixture against Levante on 15 February, in which he also scored a hat-trick.[174][175][176] Messi scored twice as Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 3–1 in the Copa del Rey final on 30 May, achieving the sixth double in their history. His opening goal was hailed as one of the greatest in his career; he collected the ball near the halfway line and beat four opposing players, before feinting the goalkeeper to score in a tight space by the near post.[177]
In the Champions League, Messi scored twice and set up another in their 3–0 semi-final victory over Bayern Munich, now under the stewardship of Guardiola.[178] His second goal, which came only three minutes after his first, saw him chip the ball over goalkeeper Manuel Neuer after his dribble past Jérôme Boateng had made the defender drop to the ground; it went viral, becoming the year's most tweeted about sporting moment, and was named the best goal of the season by UEFA.[179][180] Despite a second-leg loss, Barcelona progressed to the final on 6 June in Berlin, where they defeated Juventus 3–1 to win their second treble, becoming the first team in history to do so.[181][182] Although Messi did not score, he participated in each of his side's goals, particularly the second as he forced a parried save from goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon from which Suárez scored the match-winning goal on the rebound.[171] In addition to being the top assist provider with six assists, Messi finished the competition as the joint top scorer with ten goals, which earned him the distinction of being the first player ever to achieve the top scoring mark in five Champions League seasons.[183][184] For his efforts during the season, he received the UEFA Best Player in Europe award for a second time.[185]

2015–16: domestic success

Messi opened the 2015–16 season by scoring twice from free kicks in Barcelona's 5–4 victory (after extra time) over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup.[186] On 16 September, he became the youngest player to make 100 appearances in the UEFA Champions League in a 1–1 away draw to Roma.[187] After a knee injury, he returned to the pitch on 21 November, making a substitute appearance in Barcelona's 4–0 away win over rivals Real Madrid in El Clásico.[188] Messi capped off the year by winning the 2015 FIFA Club World Cup final on 20 December, collecting his fifth club trophy of 2015 as Barcelona defeated River Plate 3–0 in Yokohama.[189] On 30 December, Messi scored on his 500th appearance for Barcelona, in a 4–0 home win over Real Betis.[190]
On 11 January 2016, Messi won the FIFA Ballon d'Or for a record fifth time in his career.[191] On 3 February, he scored a hat-trick in Barcelona's 7–0 win against Valencia in the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-final at the Camp Nou.[192] In a 6–1 home win against Celta Vigo in the league, Messi assisted Suárez from a penalty kick. Some saw it as "a touch of genius", while others criticised it as being disrespectful to the opponent. The Celta players never complained and their coach defended the penalty, stating, "Barca's forwards are very respectful." The penalty routine has been compared to that of Barça icon Johan Cruyff in 1982, who was battling lung cancer, leading many fans to indicate that the penalty was a tribute to him. Cruyff himself was "very happy" with the play, insisting "it was legal and entertaining".[193][194]
On 17 February, Messi reached his 300th league goal in a 3–1 away win against Sporting de Gijón.[195] A few days later, he scored both goals in Barcelona's 2–0 win against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium, in the first leg of the 2015–16 UEFA Champions League round of 16, with the second goal being Barcelona's 10,000th in official competitions.[196] On 17 April, Messi ended a five-match scoring drought with his 500th senior career goal for club and country in Barcelona's 2–1 home loss to Valencia.[197] Messi finished the 2015–16 season by setting up both goals in Barcelona's 2–0 extra time win over Sevilla in the 2016 Copa del Rey final, at the Vicente Calderón Stadium, on 22 May 2016, as the club celebrated winning the domestic double for the second consecutive season.[198] In total, Messi scored 41 goals as Barcelona's attacking trio managed a Spanish record of 131 goals throughout the season, breaking the record they had set the previous season.[199]

Messi opened the 2016–17 season by lifting the 2016 Supercopa de España as Barcelona's captain in the absence of the injured Andrés Iniesta;[201] he set-up Munir's goal in a 2–0 away win over Sevilla in the first leg on 14 August,[202] and subsequently scored in a 3–0 win in the return leg on 17 August.[203] Three days later, he scored two goals as Barcelona won 6–2 against Real Betis in the opening game of the 2016–17 La Liga season.[204] On 13 September, Messi scored his first hat-trick of the season in the opening game of the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League campaign against Celtic in a 7–0 victory; this was also Messi's sixth hat-trick in the Champions League, the most by any player. A week later, Messi sustained a groin injury in a 1–1 draw against Atlético Madrid and was ruled out with injury for three weeks.[205] He marked his return with a goal, scoring three minutes after coming off the bench in a 4–0 home win over Deportivo de La Coruña, on 16 October.[206] Three days after this, he netted his thirty-seventh club hat-trick as Barcelona defeated Manchester City 4–0.[207] On 1 November, Messi scored his 54th Champions League group stage goal in Barcelona's 3–1 away loss to Manchester City, surpassing the previous record of 53 goals held by Raúl.[208]

Messi finished the year with 51 goals, making him Europe's top scorer, one ahead of Zlatan Ibrahimović.[209] After placing second in the 2016 Ballon d'Or, on 9 January 2017 Messi also finished in second place – behind Cristiano Ronaldo once again – in the 2016 Best FIFA Men's Player Award.[210] On 11 January, Messi scored from a free-kick in Barcelona's 3–1 victory against Athletic Bilbao in the second leg of the round of 16 of the Copa del Rey, which enabled Barcelona to advance to the quarter-finals of the competition; with his 26th goal from a free-kick for Barcelona in all competitions, he equalled the club's all-time record, which had previously been set by Ronald Koeman.[211] In his next league match, on 14 January, Messi scored in a 5–0 win against Las Palmas; with this goal, he equalled Raúl's record for the most teams scored against in La Liga (35).[212]
On 4 February 2017, Messi scored his 27th free-kick for Barcelona in a 3–0 home win over Athletic Bilbao in the league, overtaking Koeman as the club's all-time top-scorer from free-kicks.[213] On 23 April, Messi scored twice in a 3–2 away win over Real Madrid. His game-winning goal in stoppage time was his 500th for Barcelona.[214] His memorable celebration saw him taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans – with his name and number facing the crowd.[215] On 27 May, Messi scored a goal and set up another for Paco Alcácer in the 2017 Copa del Rey final, helping Barcelona to a 3–1 victory over Alavés, and was named Man of the Match.[216] In total, Messi finished the 2016–17 season with 54 goals, while his 37 goals in La Liga saw him claim both the Pichichi and European Golden Boot Awards for the fourth time in his career.[217]

2017–18: domestic double and a record fifth Golden Boot

August 2020: desire to leave Barcelona

However, Messi remained on the bench during the entire match and did not play due to a reported injury, which aroused the anger of the fans at the stadium, who chanted "refund" (Cantonese: 回水).[380] Messi's personal social media accounts were flooded by comments of unsatisfied fans.[381] Legislative Council Member Kenneth Fok issued a statement condemning the organizer Tatler and Inter Miami, believing that both of them were responsible, when the latter received sky-high remuneration, but made the fans leave disappointed and owed them  an apology.[382] The Government of Hong Kong also expressed extreme disappointment at Messi's absence and stated that it was considering revoking the HK$16 million sponsorship funds.[383][384] This incident was dubbed "Messi Messy" by CNN,[385] and translated as "Messi's Chaos" by the Hong Kong media.[386] On 6 February 2024, Messi and his teammates were full of energy when practicing in Japan. Besides passing the ball, Messi was also able to kick the ball into the goal. This left the fans in Hong Kong suspicious that he had not been injured during the aforementioned match.[387] On 8 February 2024, the Chinese Football Association temporarily halted its partnership with the Argentine Football Association over the incident.[388]
A friendly match against Vissel Kobe was held on 7 February 2024. Messi started on the bench, but in the 60th minute of the second half, he came on as a substitute. In the 78th minute, a Messi shot but was saved by the opposing goalkeeper. Although Messi was very active on the pitch, he failed to score. The match ended in a 0–0 draw, and penalties were required to decide the outcome of the encounter. Messi did not participate in the shoot-out, which caused boos from the crow; Inter Miami lost 4–3 in the shoot-out.[389]

International career
It has been suggested that this section be split out  into another article titled Career of Lionel Messi. (Discuss) (January 2024)
2004–2005: success at youth level
As a dual Argentine-Spanish national, Messi was eligible to play for the national team of both countries.[390] Selectors for Spain's Under-17 squad began pursuing him in 2003 after Barcelona's director of football, Carles Rexach, alerted the Royal Spanish Football Federation to their young player. Messi declined the offer, having aspired to represent La Albiceleste since childhood. To further prevent Spain from taking him, the Argentine Football Association organised two under-20 friendlies in June 2004, against Paraguay and Uruguay, with the purpose of finalising his status as an Argentina player in FIFA. Five days after his 17th birthday, on 29 June, he made his debut for his country against Paraguay, scoring once and providing two assists in their 8–0 victory. He was subsequently included in the squad for the South American Youth Championship, held in Colombia in February 2005. As he lacked the stamina of his teammates, the result of his former growth hormone deficiency, he was used as a substitute in six of the nine games. After being named man of the match against Venezuela, he scored the winning 2–1 goal in the crucial last match against Brazil, thereby securing their third-place qualification for the FIFA World Youth Championship.[391]
Aware of his physical limitations, Messi employed a personal trainer to increase his muscle mass, returning to the squad in an improved condition in time for the World Youth Championship, hosted by the Netherlands in June. After he was left out of the starting line-up in their first match against the United States, a 1–0 defeat, the squad's senior players asked manager Francisco Ferraro to let Messi start, as they considered him their best player. After helping the team defeat Egypt and Germany to progress past the group stage, Messi proved decisive in the knockout phase as he scored their equaliser against Colombia, provided a goal and an assist against title favourites Spain, and scored their opening goal against reigning champions Brazil. Ahead of the final, he was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament. He scored two penalties in their 2–1 victory over Nigeria, clinching Argentina's fifth championship and finishing the tournament as top scorer with 6 goals.[392][393] His performances drew comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona, who had led Argentina to the title in 1979.[393]

2005–2006: senior and World Cup debuts
In recognition of his achievements with the under-20 side, senior manager José Pékerman gave Messi his first call-up for a friendly against Hungary on 17 August 2005. Aged 18, Messi made his senior debut for Argentina in the Ferenc Puskás Stadium when he came on in the 63rd minute, only to be sent off after two minutes for a perceived foul against Vilmos Vanczák, who had grabbed his shirt; Messi had struck the defender with his arm while trying to shake him off, which the referee interpreted as an intentional elbowing, a contentious decision.[394] Messi was reportedly found weeping in the dressing room after his sending-off.[395] He returned to the team on 3 September in their World Cup qualifier defeat to Paraguay, which he had declared his "re-debut" ahead of the match.[396] Messi started his first game in the next qualifying match against Peru, in which he was able to win a crucial penalty that secured their victory. After the match, Pékerman described him as "a jewel".[397] He subsequently made regular appearances for the team ahead of Argentina's participation in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, scoring his first goal in a friendly against Croatia on 1 March 2006.[398] A hamstring injury sustained a week later jeopardised his presence in the World Cup, but he was nevertheless selected for Pékerman's squad and regained fitness in time for the start of the tournament.[399]
During the World Cup in Germany, Messi witnessed their opening match victory against the Ivory Coast from the substitutes' bench. In the next match, against Serbia and Montenegro, he became the youngest player to represent Argentina at a FIFA World Cup when he came on as a substitute in the 74th minute. He assisted their fourth strike within minutes and scored the final goal in their 6–0 victory, making him the youngest scorer in the tournament and the sixth-youngest goalscorer in the history of the World Cup.[400] As their progression to the knockout phase was secured, several starters were rested during the last group match. Messi consequently started the game against the Netherlands, a 0–0 draw, as they won their group on goal differential.[401][402] In the round of 16 match against Mexico, played on his 19th birthday, Messi came on in the 84th minute, with the score tied at 1–1. He appeared to score a goal, but it was contentiously ruled offside, with the team needing a late goal in extra time to proceed.[403][404] He did not play in the quarter-final against Germany, during which Argentina were eliminated 4–2 in a penalty shootout.[405] Back home, Pékerman's decision to leave him on the bench against Germany led to widespread criticism from those who believed Messi could have changed the outcome of the match in Argentina's favour.[406][407]

2007–2008: Copa América final and Olympic gold
Messi evades Brazil's Marcelo in the semi-final of the 2008 Summer Olympics
As Messi evolved into one of the best players in the world, he secured a place in Alfio Basile's starting line-up, as part of a team considered favourites to win the 2007 Copa América, held in Venezuela.[64][408] He set up the game-winning goal of their 4–1 victory over the United States in the opening match, before winning a penalty that led to the game-tying first strike of their 4–2 win in the next match against Colombia.[409][410] At the quarter-final stage, where the group winners faced Peru, he scored the second goal of a 4–0 victory that saw them through to the semi-final, during which he chipped the ball over Mexico's goalkeeper to ensure another 3–0 win.[408] In a surprise defeat, Argentina lost the final 3–0 to a Brazil squad that lacked several of the nation's best players.[411] Their unexpected loss was followed by much criticism in Argentina, though Messi was mostly exempt due to his young age and secondary status to star player Juan Román Riquelme.[408] He was named the best young player of the tournament by CONMEBOL.[412]
Ahead of the 2008 Summer Olympics, Barcelona legally barred Messi from representing Argentina at the tournament as it coincided with their Champions League qualifying matches.[413] After interference from newly appointed Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola, who had won the tournament in 1992, Messi was permitted to join Sergio Batista's under-23 squad in Beijing.[414] During the first match, he scored the opening goal in their 2–1 victory over the Ivory Coast. Following a 1–0 win in the next group match against Australia, ensuring their quarter-final qualification, Messi was rested during the game against Serbia, while his side won the match to finish first in their group. Against the Netherlands, he again scored the first goal and assisted a second strike to help his team to a 2–1 win in extra time. After a 3–0 semi-final victory over Brazil, Messi assisted the only goal in the final as Argentina defeated Nigeria to claim Olympic gold medals.[415] Along with Riquelme, Messi was singled out by FIFA as the stand-out player from the tournament's best team.[416]

2008–2011: collective decline
From late 2008, the national team experienced a three-year period marked by poor performances.[408] Under manager Diego Maradona, who had led Argentina to World Cup victory as a player, the team struggled to qualify for the 2010 World Cup, securing their place in the tournament only after defeating Uruguay 1–0 in their last qualifying match. Maradona was criticised for his strategic decisions, which included playing Messi out of his usual position. In eight qualifying matches under Maradona's stewardship, Messi scored only one goal, netting the opening goal in the first such match, a 4–0 victory over Venezuela.[398][417] During that game, played on 28 March 2009, he wore Argentina's number 10 shirt for the first time, following the international retirement of Riquelme.[418] Overall, Messi scored four goals in 18 appearances during the qualifying process.[398] Ahead of the tournament, Maradona visited Messi in Barcelona to request his tactical input; Messi then outlined a 4–3–1–2 formation with himself playing behind the two strikers, a playmaking position known as the enganche in Argentine football, which had been his preferred position since childhood.[419]

Messi in action during the opening match against Bolivia at the 2011 Copa América
Despite their poor qualifying campaign, Argentina were considered title contenders at the World Cup in South Africa. At the start of the tournament, the new formation proved effective; Messi managed at least four attempts on goal during their opening match but was repeatedly denied by Nigeria's goalkeeper, resulting in a 1–0 win. During the next match, against South Korea, he excelled in his playmaking role, participating in all four goals of his side's 4–1 victory. As their place in the knockout phase was guaranteed, most of the starters were rested during the last group match, but Messi reportedly refused to be benched.[417] He wore the captain's armband for the first time in their 2–0 win against Greece; as the focal point of their play, he helped create their second goal to see Argentina finish as group winners.[420]
Argentina were eliminated in the quarter-final against Germany, at the same stage of the tournament and by the same opponent as four years earlier. Their 4–0 loss was their worst margin of defeat at a World Cup since 1974.[421] FIFA subsequently identified Messi as one of the tournament's 10 best players, citing his "outstanding" pace and creativity and "spectacular and efficient" dribbling, shooting and passing.[422] Back home, however, Messi was the subject of harsher judgement. As the perceived best player in the world, he had been expected to lead an average team to the title, as Maradona arguably did in 1986, but he had failed to replicate his performances at Barcelona with the national team, leading to the accusation that he cared less about his country than his club.[423]
Maradona was replaced by Sergio Batista, who had orchestrated Argentina's Olympic victory. Batista publicly stated that he intended to build the team around Messi, employing him as a false nine within a 4–3–3 system, as used to much success by Barcelona.[423][424] Although Messi scored a record 53 goals during the 2010–11 club season, he had not scored for Argentina in an official match since March 2009.[114][398] Despite the tactical change, his goal drought continued during the 2011 Copa América, hosted by Argentina. Their first two matches, against Bolivia and Colombia, ended in draws. Media and fans noted that he did not combine well with striker Carlos Tevez, who enjoyed greater popularity among the Argentine public; Messi was consequently booed by his own team's supporters for the first time in his career. During the crucial next match, with Tevez on the bench, he gave a well-received performance, assisting two goals in their 3–0 victory over Costa Rica. After the quarter-final against Uruguay ended in a 1–1 draw following extra time, with Messi having assisted their equaliser, Argentina were eliminated 4–5 in the penalty shootout by the eventual champions.[423]

2011–2013: assuming the captaincy
Messi scored his first international hat-trick against Switzerland in 2012.
After Argentina's unsuccessful performance in the Copa América, Batista was replaced by Alejandro Sabella. Upon his appointment in August 2011, Sabella awarded the 24-year-old Messi the captaincy of the squad, in accord with then-captain Javier Mascherano. Reserved by nature, Messi went on to lead his squad by example as their best player, while Mascherano continued to fulfil the role of the team's on-field leader and motivator.[425][426] In a further redesign of the team, Sabella dismissed Tevez and brought in players with whom Messi had won the World Youth Championship and Olympic Games. Now playing in a free role in an improving team, Messi ended his goal drought by scoring during their first World Cup qualifying match against Chile on 7 October, his first official goal for Argentina in two-and-a-half years.[398][425]
Under Sabella, Messi's goalscoring rate drastically increased; where he had scored only 17 goals in 61 matches under his previous managers, he scored 25 times in 32 appearances during the following three years.[398][425] He netted a total of 12 goals in 9 games for Argentina in 2012, equalling the record held by Gabriel Batistuta for the most goals scored in a calendar year for their country.[427] His first international hat-trick came in a friendly against Switzerland on 29 February 2012, followed by two more hat-tricks over the next year-and-a-half in friendlies against Brazil and Guatemala. Messi then helped the team secure their place in the 2014 World Cup with a 5–2 victory over Paraguay on 10 September 2013 when he scored twice from penalty kicks, taking his international tally to 37 goals to become Argentina's second-highest goalscorer behind Batistuta. Overall, he had scored a total of 10 goals in 14 matches during the qualifying campaign.[398][428] Concurrently with his bettered performances, his relationship with his compatriots improved, as he gradually began to be perceived more favourably in Argentina.[425]

2014–2015: World Cup and Copa América finals
Messi watches his 25-yard curling strike hit the net against Iran to win the game for Argentina in their second group game at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
Ahead of the World Cup in Brazil, doubts persisted over Messi's form, as he finished an unsuccessful and injury-plagued season with Barcelona. At the start of the tournament, however, he gave strong performances, being elected man of the match in their first four matches.[429] In his first World Cup match as captain, he led them to a 2–1 victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina; he helped create Sead Kolašinac's own goal and scored their second strike after a dribble past three players, his first World Cup goal since his debut in the tournament eight years earlier.[430] During the second match against Iran, he scored an injury-time goal from 25 yards out to end the game in a 1–0 win, securing their qualification for the knockout phase.[431] He scored twice in the last group match, a 3–2 victory over Nigeria, his second goal coming from a free kick, as they finished first in their group.[432] Messi assisted a late goal in extra time to ensure a 1–0 win against Switzerland in the round of 16, and played in the 1–0 quarter-final win against Belgium as Argentina progressed to the semi-final of the World Cup for the first time since 1990.[433][434] Following a 0–0 draw in extra time, they eliminated the Netherlands 4–2 in a penalty shootout to reach the final, with Messi scoring his team's first penalty.[435]

Messi battles Germany's Mats Hummels for the ball during the 2014 FIFA World Cup final.
Billed as Messi versus Germany, the world's best player against the best team, the final was a repeat of the 1990 final featuring Diego Maradona.[436] Within the first half-hour, Messi had started the play that led to a goal, but it was ruled offside. He missed several opportunities to open the scoring throughout the match, in particular at the start of the second half when his breakaway effort went wide of the far post. Substitute Mario Götze finally scored in the 113th minute, followed in the last minute of extra time by a free kick that Messi sent over the net, as Germany won the match 1–0 to claim the World Cup.[437] At the conclusion of the final, Messi was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament. In addition to being the joint third-highest goalscorer, with four goals and an assist, he created the most chances, completed the most dribbling runs, made the most deliveries into the penalty area and produced the most throughballs in the competition.[429][438] However, his selection drew criticism due to his lack of goals in the knockout round; FIFA President Sepp Blatter expressed his surprise, while Maradona suggested that Messi had undeservedly been chosen for marketing purposes.[439]
Another final appearance, the third of Messi's senior international career, followed in the 2015 Copa América, held in Chile. Under the stewardship of former Barcelona manager Gerardo Martino, Argentina entered the tournament as title contenders due to their second-place achievement at the World Cup.[440][441] During the opening match against Paraguay, they were ahead two goals by half-time but lost their lead to end the match in a 2–2 draw; Messi had scored from a penalty kick, netting his only goal in the tournament.[442] Following a 1–0 win against defending champions Uruguay, Messi earned his 100th cap for his country in the final group match, a 1–0 win over Jamaica, becoming only the fifth Argentine to achieve this milestone.[443] In his 100 appearances, he had scored a total of 46 goals for Argentina, 22 of which came in official competitive matches.[398][443]
As Messi evolved from the team's symbolic captain into a genuine leader, he led Argentina to the knockout stage as group winners.[444] In the quarter-final, they created numerous chances, including a rebound header by Messi, but were repeatedly denied by Colombia's goalkeeper, and ultimately ended the match scoreless, leading to a 5–4 penalty shootout in their favour, with Messi netting his team's first spot kick.[445] At the semi-final stage, Messi excelled as a playmaker as he provided three assists and helped create three more goals in his side's 6–1 victory over Paraguay, receiving applause from the initially hostile crowd.[444] Argentina started the final as the odds-on title favourites, but were defeated by Chile 4–1 in a penalty shootout after a 0–0 extra-time draw. Faced with aggression from opposing players, including taking a boot to the midriff, Messi played below his standards, though he was the only Argentine to successfully convert his penalty.[446] At the close of the tournament, he was reportedly selected to receive the Most Valuable Player award but rejected the honour.[447] As Argentina continued a trophy drought that began in 1993, the World Cup and Copa América defeats again brought intense criticism for Messi from Argentine media and fans.[448]

2016–2017: third Copa América final, first retirement, and return
Messi's place in Argentina's Copa América Centenario squad was initially put in jeopardy when he sustained a back injury in a 1–0 friendly win over Honduras in a pre-Copa América warm-up match on 27 May 2016.[449] It was later reported that he had suffered a deep bruise in his lumbar region. He was later left on the bench in Argentina's 2–1 opening win over defending champions Chile on 6 June due to concerns regarding his fitness.[450] Although Messi was declared match-fit for his nation's second group match against Panama on 10 June, Martino left him on the bench once again; he replaced Augusto Fernández in the 61st minute and subsequently scored a hat-trick in 19 minutes, also starting the play which led to Sergio Agüero's goal, as the match ended in a 5–0 victory, sealing Argentina's place in the quarter-finals of the competition;[451] he was elected man of the match for his performance.[452]



"Did it annoy me that Messi took the record? A little, yes. You go around the world and people say, 'he's the top scorer for the Argentina national team.' But the advantage I have is that I'm second to an extraterrestrial."


– Gabriel Batistuta on the consolation of Messi breaking his record.[453]

On 18 June, in the quarter-final of the Copa América against Venezuela, Messi produced another man of the match performance,[454] assisting two goals and scoring another in a 4–1 victory, which enabled him to equal Gabriel Batistuta's national record of 54 goals in official international matches.[455] This record was broken three days later when Messi scored a free kick in a 4–0 semi-final win against hosts the United States; he also assisted two goals during the match as Argentina sealed a place in the final of the competition for a second consecutive year,[456] and was named man of the match once again.[457]
During a repeat of the previous year's final on 26 June, Argentina once again lost to Chile on penalties after a 0–0 deadlock, resulting in Messi's third consecutive defeat in a major tournament final with Argentina, and his fourth overall. After the match, Messi, who had missed his penalty in the shootout, announced his retirement from international football.[458] He stated, "I tried my hardest. The team has ended for me, a decision made."[459] Chile coach Juan Antonio Pizzi said after the match, "My generation can't compare him to Maradona that's for my generation, because of what Maradona did for Argentine football. But I think the best player ever played today here in the United States."[460] Messi finished the tournament as the second highest scorer, behind Eduardo Vargas, with five goals, and was the highest assist provider with four assists, also winning more Man of the Match awards than any other player in the tournament (3);[461] he was named to the team of the tournament for his performances, but missed out on the Golden Ball Award for best player, which went to Alexis Sánchez.[462]
Following his announcement, a campaign began in Argentina for Messi to change his mind about retiring.[463] He was greeted by fans with signs like "Don't go, Leo" when the team landed in Buenos Aires. President of Argentina Mauricio Macri urged Messi not to quit, stating, "We are lucky, it is one of life's pleasures, it is a gift from God to have the best player in the world in a footballing country like ours... Lionel Messi is the greatest thing we have in Argentina and we must take care of him."[464] Mayor of Buenos Aires Horacio Rodríguez Larreta unveiled a statue of Messi in the capital to convince him to reconsider retirement.[465] The campaign also continued in the streets and avenues of the Argentine capital, with about 50,000 supporters going to the Obelisco de Buenos Aires on 2 July, using the same slogan.[466]



"A lot of things went through my mind on the night of the final and I gave serious thought to quitting, but my love for my country and this shirt is too great."


– Messi reversing his decision from retiring on 12 August 2016[467]

Just a week after Messi announced his international retirement, Argentine newspaper La Nación reported that he was reconsidering playing for Argentina at the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in September.[468] On 12 August, it was confirmed that Messi had reversed his decision to retire from international football, and he was included in the squad for the national team's upcoming 2018 World Cup qualifiers.[469] On 1 September, in his first game back, he scored in a 1–0 home win over Uruguay in a 2018 World Cup qualifier.[470]

Messi celebrates his hat-trick against Ecuador in 2017 which saw Argentina qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
On 28 March 2017, Messi was suspended for four international games for insulting an assistant referee in a game against Chile on 23 March 2017. He was also fined CHF 10,000.[471][472] On 5 May, Messi's four match ban as well as his 10,000 CHF fine was lifted by FIFA after Argentina Football Association appealed against his suspension, which meant he could now play Argentina's remaining World Cup Qualifiers.[473] Argentina's place in the 2018 World Cup was in jeopardy going into their final qualifying match as they were sixth in their group, outside the five possible CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying spots, meaning they risked failing to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1970. On 10 October, Messi led his country to World Cup qualification in scoring a hat-trick as Argentina came from behind to defeat Ecuador 3–1 away; Argentina had not defeated Ecuador in Quito since 2001.[474] Messi's three goals saw him become the joint all-time leading scorer in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers with 21 goals, alongside Uruguay's Luis Suárez, overtaking the previous record which was held by compatriot Hernán Crespo.[474]

Following on from their poor qualification campaign, expectations were not high going into the 2018 World Cup, with the team, without an injured Messi, losing 6–1 to Spain in March 2018.[476][477] Prior to Argentina's opener, there was speculation in the media over whether this would be Messi's final World Cup.[478] In the team's opening group match against Iceland on 16 June, Messi missed a potential match-winning penalty in an eventual 1–1 draw.[479] In Argentina's second game on 21 June, the team lost 3–0 to Croatia in a huge upset. Post-match the Argentina coach Jorge Sampaoli spoke of the lack of quality in the team surrounding Messi, saying "we quite simply couldn't pass to him to help him generate the situations he is used to. We worked to give him the ball but the opponent also worked hard to prevent him from getting the ball. We lost that battle".[480] Croatia captain and midfielder Luka Modrić also stated post match, "Messi is an incredible player but he can't do everything alone."[481]

Messi celebrates his goal against Nigeria at the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
In Argentina's final group match against Nigeria at the Krestovsky Stadium, Saint Petersburg on 26 June, Messi scored the opening goal in an eventual 2–1 victory, becoming the third Argentine after Diego Maradona and Gabriel Batistuta to score in three different World Cups; he also became the first player to score in the World Cup in his teens, twenties, and his thirties.[482] A goal of the tournament contender, Messi received a long pass from midfield and controlled the ball on the run with two touches before striking it across goal into the net with his weaker right foot.[483][484] He was awarded Man of the Match.[485] Argentina progressed to the second round as group runners-up behind Croatia.[486] In the round of 16 match against eventual champions France on 30 June, Messi set up Gabriel Mercado's and Sergio Agüero's goals in a 3–4 defeat, which saw Argentina eliminated from the World Cup.[487] With his two assists in his team's second round fixture, Messi became the first player to provide an assist in the last four World Cups, and also became the first player to provide two assists in a match for Argentina since Maradona had managed the same feat against South Korea in 1986.[488][489]
Following the tournament, Messi stated that he would not participate in Argentina's friendlies against Guatemala and Colombia in September, and commented that it would be unlikely that he would represent his nation for the remainder of the calendar year. Messi's absence from the national team and his continued failure to win a title with Argentina prompted speculation in the media that Messi might retire from international football once again.[490] In March 2019, however, he was called up to the Argentina squad once again for the team's friendlies against Venezuela and Morocco later that month.[491] A conversation with Lionel Scaloni and his idol Pablo Aimar made Messi reconsider his decision to retire.[492] He made his international return on 22 March, in a 3–1 friendly defeat to Venezuela, in Madrid.[493]

2019–2020: Copa América third-place and suspension
On 21 May, Messi was included in Scaloni's final 23-man squad for the 2019 Copa América.[494] In Argentina's second group match on 19 June, Messi scored the equalising goal from the penalty spot in a 1–1 draw against Paraguay.[495] After coming under criticism in the media over his performance following Argentina's 2–0 quarter-final victory over Venezuela on 28 June, Messi commented that it had not been his best Copa América, while also criticising the poor quality of the pitches.[496] Following Argentina's 2–0 semi-final defeat to hosts Brazil on 2 July, Messi was critical of the refereeing,[497][498] and alleged the competition was "set up" for Brazil to win.[499]
In the third-place match against Chile on 6 July, Messi set-up Agüero's opening goal from a free kick in an eventual 2–1 win, to help Argentina win the bronze medal; however, he was sent off along with Gary Medel in the 37th minute of play, after being involved in an altercation with the Chilean defender.[500] Following the match, Messi refused to collect his medal, and implied in a post-match interview that his comments following the semi-final led to his sending off.[501] Messi later issued an apology for his comments, but was fined $1,500 and was handed a one-match ban by CONMEBOL, which ruled him out of Argentina's next World Cup qualifier.[502] On 2 August, Messi was banned for three months from international football and was fined $50,000 by CONMEBOL for his comments against the referee's decisions; this ban meant he would miss Argentina's friendly matches against Chile, Mexico and Germany in September and October.[503] On 15 November, Messi played in the 2019 Superclásico de las Américas versus Brazil, scoring the winning goal by a rebound of his saved penalty.[504] On 8 October 2020, Messi scored a penalty in a 1–0 victory against Ecuador, giving Argentina a winning start to their 2022 World Cup qualifying campaign.[505]

On 14 June 2021, Messi scored from a free kick in a 1–1 draw against Chile in Argentina's opening group match of the 2021 Copa América in Brazil.[507] On 21 June, Messi played in his 147th match as he equalled Javier Mascherano's record for most appearances for Argentina in a 1–0 win over Paraguay in their third game of the tournament.[508] A week later, he broke the record when he featured in a 4–1 win against Bolivia in his team's final group match, assisting Papu Gómez's opening goal and later scoring two.[509] On 3 July, Messi assisted twice and scored from a free-kick in a 3–0 win over Ecuador in the quarter-finals of the competition.[510] On 6 July, in a 1–1 draw in the semi-finals against Colombia, Messi made his 150th appearance for his country and registered his fifth assist of the tournament, a cut-back for Lautaro Martínez, matching his record of nine goal contributions in a single tournament from five years earlier; he later scored his spot kick in Argentina's eventual 3–2 penalty shoot-out victory to progress to his fifth international final.[511][512] On 10 July, Argentina defeated hosts and defending champions Brazil 1–0 in the final, giving Messi his first major international title and Argentina's first since 1993, as well as his nation's joint record 15th Copa América overall.[513][514] Messi was directly involved in nine out of the 12 goals scored by Argentina, scoring four and assisting five; he was named the player of the tournament for his performances, an honour he shared with Neymar. He also finished as top scorer with four goals tied with Colombia's Luis Díaz, with the Golden Boot awarded to Messi as he had more assists.[515][516]
On 9 September, Messi scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 home win over Bolivia in a 2022 World Cup qualifier which also moved him above Pelé as South America's top male international scorer with 79 goals.[517] In the 2022 Finalissima, the third edition of the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions, at Wembley on 2 June 2022, Messi assisted twice in a 3–0 victory against Italy and was named player of the match, securing his second trophy for Argentina at the senior level.[518] Messi then followed this on 6 June with all five Argentina goals in a 5–0 victory in a friendly win over Estonia, overtaking Ferenc Puskás among the all-time international men's top scorers.[519]

Messi at the 2022 FIFA World Cup
At the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, Messi scored a penalty in Argentina's opening game, a 2–1 defeat to Saudi Arabia, before scoring with a low 20-yard strike in their next match against Mexico in which Argentina won 2–0, also recording an assist on Enzo Fernández's goal.[520] In the last 16 game against Australia, Messi scored the opening goal in Argentina's 2–1 win in what was his 1,000th senior career appearance,[521] and became the most-capped male South American (CONMEBOL member) footballer of all time, surpassing the previous record set by Ecuador's Iván Hurtado, as well as surpassing and equalling several other FIFA World Cup and national team records.[522][523] In the quarter-final against the Netherlands, Messi assisted Argentina's first goal for Nahuel Molina with a reverse pass and then scored a penalty as the game finished 2–2 after extra time. Argentina won 4–3 in the penalty shootout, with Messi scoring the first penalty.[524] In the semi-final against Croatia, Messi made a record-equalling 25th World Cup finals appearance, drawing level with Germany's Lothar Matthäus, and scored the opening goal with a penalty before he assisted Argentina's third goal scored by Julián Álvarez in a 3–0 win;[525] with his 11th World Cup goal, Messi overtook Batistuta to become Argentina's all-time top-scorer at the World Cup.[526] Argentina advanced to the final against France, with Messi stating that it would be his final World Cup appearance.[527][528]
In the 2022 FIFA World Cup final on 18 December, Messi made his record 26th World Cup match appearance at Lusail Stadium. He scored Argentina's opening goal with a penalty, becoming in the process the first player since the last-16 round was introduced in 1986 to score a goal in every round of a single World Cup edition.[529][530] After Argentina's eventual two-goal lead was erased by France forward Kylian Mbappé, who scored twice inside two minutes, Messi would score again in extra-time to restore Argentina's lead, before Mbappé again drew France level. Tied 3–3 after extra-time, the match went to a penalty shoot-out. Messi scored Argentina's first goal in the shoot-out, with Argentina eventually winning 4–2, ending the nation's 36-year wait for the trophy.[531] Messi received the Golden Ball for player of the tournament, becoming the first player to win it twice. He finished second in the Golden Boot race with seven goals in seven games, one behind Mbappé.[530] With his appearance and two goals in the final, Messi overtook Matthaüs as the player with most appearances at the World Cup (26), and Pelé as the player with most direct goal contributions at the World Cup (21 – 13 goals and 8 assists).[532] The championship game was widely acclaimed as one of the best of all time, with media coverage heavily framing it as a duel between Messi and Mbappé.[533][534][535][536] Following the game, Messi confirmed that he had no plans to retire from the national team, saying "I want to continue playing as a champion".[537] In December 2023, a set of jerseys he had worn during the World Cup was sold at auction for 7.8 million dollars.[538]

2023–present: 100 international goals
In March 2023, Messi made his return to Argentina as a world champion with two appearances in friendlies in his home country. He scored his 99th international goal with a free-kick in Argentina's 2–0 win over Panama; this also marked his 800th senior career goal for club and country.[539] In the following match against Curaçao, Messi scored a hat-trick, his ninth for Argentina, and recorded an assist in a 7–0 win. The first of his three goals saw him reach 100 international goals, making Messi the third player in history to reach the milestone.[540]

Player profile
Style of play
A versatile forward, Messi often plays as a classic number 10.
Due to his short stature, Messi has a lower centre of gravity than taller players, which gives him greater agility, allowing him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles;[541][542] this has led the Spanish media to dub him La Pulga Atómica ("The Atomic Flea").[543][544][545] Despite being physically unimposing, he possesses significant upper-body strength, which, combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance, aids him in withstanding physical challenges from opponents; he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with playacting.[18][542][546] His short, strong legs allow him to excel in short bursts of acceleration while his quick feet enable him to retain control of the ball when dribbling at speed.[547] His former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola once stated, "Messi is the only player that runs faster with the ball than he does without it."[48] Although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot since his mid-20s, Messi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists.[548][549]
A prolific goalscorer, Messi is known for his finishing, positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line. He also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and range of passing.[550] He has often been described as a magician; a conjurer, creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist.[551][552][553] Moreover, he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker.[542][554] As of September 2023, Messi ranks 5th all time in goals scored from direct free kicks with 65,[555] the most among active players.[556] He also has a penchant for scoring from chips.[557]

Messi is known to drop deep, link-up with midfielders, orchestrate attacking plays, and create goal-scoring opportunities.
Messi's pace and technical ability enable him to undertake individual dribbling runs towards goal, in particular during counterattacks, usually starting from the halfway line or the right side of the pitch.[546][554][558] Widely considered to be the best dribbler in the world,[559] and one of the greatest dribblers of all time,[560] with regard to this ability, his former Argentina manager Diego Maradona has said of him, "The ball stays glued to his foot; I've seen great players in my career, but I've never seen anyone with Messi's ball control."[549] Beyond his individual qualities, he is also a well-rounded, hard-working team player, known for his creative combinations, in particular with former Barcelona midfielders Xavi and Andrés Iniesta.[541][542]
Tactically, Messi plays in a free attacking role; a versatile player, he is capable of attacking on either wing or through the centre of the pitch. His favoured position in childhood was the playmaker behind two strikers, known as the enganche in Argentine football, but he began his career in Spain as a left-winger or left-sided forward.[419] Upon his first-team debut, he was moved onto the right wing by manager Frank Rijkaard; from this position, he could more easily cut through the defence into the middle of the pitch and curl shots on goal with his left foot, rather than predominantly cross balls for teammates.[48] Under Guardiola and subsequent managers, he most often played in a false nine role; positioned as a centre-forward or lone striker, he would roam the centre, often moving deep into midfield and drawing defenders with him, in order to create and exploit spaces for passes, other teammates' attacking runs off the ball, Messi's own dribbling runs, or combinations with Xavi and Iniesta.[26] Under the stewardship of Luis Enrique, Messi initially returned to playing in the right-sided position that characterised much of his early career in the manager's 4–3–3 formation,[168][561] while he was increasingly deployed in a deeper, free playmaking role in later seasons.[562][563] Under manager Ernesto Valverde, Messi played in a variety of roles. While he occasionally continued to be deployed in a deeper role, from which he could make runs from behind into the box,[564] or even on the right wing[565] or as a false nine,[566][567] he was also used in a more offensive, central role in a 4–2–3–1,[563] or as a second striker in a 4–4–2 formation, where he was once again given the licence to drop deep, link-up with midfielders, orchestrate his team's attacking plays, and create chances for his attacking partner Suárez.[568][569]

Messi prepares to shoot with his dominant left foot in the 2014 FIFA World Cup final.
As his career advanced, and his tendency to dribble diminished slightly with age, Messi began to dictate play in deeper areas of the pitch and developed into one of the best passers and playmakers in football history.[570][571][572] His work-rate off the ball and defensive responsibilities also decreased as his career progressed; by covering less ground on the pitch, and instead conserving his energy for short bursts of speed, he was able to improve his efficiency, movement, and positional play, and was also able to avoid muscular injuries, despite often playing a large number of matches throughout a particular season on a consistent basis. Indeed, while he was injury-prone in his early career, he was later able to improve his injury record by running less off the ball, and by adopting a stricter diet, training regime, and sleep schedule.[573] With the Argentina national team, Messi has similarly played anywhere along the frontline; under various managers, he has been employed on the right wing, as a false nine, as an out-and-out striker, in a supporting role alongside another forward, or in a deeper, free creative role as a classic number 10 playmaker or attacking midfielder behind the strikers.[424][574]

Reception and comparisons to Diego Maradona
Main article: New Maradona


"I have seen the player who will inherit my place in Argentinian football and his name is Messi."


– Diego Maradona hailing the 18-year-old Messi as his successor in February 2006[71]

A prodigious talent as a teenager, Messi established himself among the world's best players before age 20.[64] Diego Maradona considered the 18-year-old Messi the best player in the world alongside Ronaldinho, while the Brazilian himself, shortly after winning the 2005 Ballon d'Or, commented, "I'm not even the best at Barça", in reference to his protégé.[575][576] Four years later, after Messi had won his first Ballon d'Or by a record margin,[78] the public debate regarding his qualities as a player moved beyond his status in contemporary football to the possibility that he was one of the greatest players in history.[14][546][577] An early proponent was his then-manager Pep Guardiola, who, as early as August 2009, declared Messi to be the best player he had ever seen.[578] In the following years, this opinion gained greater acceptance among pundits, managers, former and current players,[116][579] and by the end of Barça's second treble-winning season, the view of Messi as one of the greatest footballers of all time had become the apparent view among many fans and pundits in continental Europe.[580][581] He initially received several dismissals by critics, based on the fact that he had not won an international trophy at senior level with Argentina,[582] until he won his first at the 2021 Copa América.[583]

Throughout his career, Messi has been compared with his late compatriot Diego Maradona, due to their similar playing styles as diminutive, left-footed dribblers. Initially, he was merely one of many young Argentine players, including his boyhood idol Pablo Aimar, to receive the "New Maradona" moniker, but as his career progressed, Messi proved his similarity beyond all previous contenders, establishing himself as the greatest player Argentina had produced since Maradona.[22][417] Jorge Valdano, who won the 1986 World Cup alongside Maradona, said in October 2013, "Messi is Maradona every day. For the last five years, Messi has been the Maradona of the World Cup in Mexico."[584] César Menotti, who as manager orchestrated their 1978 World Cup victory, echoed this sentiment when he opined that Messi plays "at the level of the best Maradona".[585] Other notable Argentines in the sport, such as Osvaldo Ardiles, Javier Zanetti, and Diego Simeone, have expressed their belief that Messi has overtaken Maradona as the best player in history.[586][587][588]
In Argentine society, prior to 2019, Messi was generally held in lesser esteem than Maradona, a consequence of not only his perceived uneven performances with the national team, but also of differences in class, personality, and background. Messi is in some ways the antithesis of his predecessor: where Maradona was an extroverted, controversial character who rose to greatness from the slums, Messi is reserved and unassuming, an unremarkable man outside of football.[390][589][590] An enduring mark against him is the fact that, through no fault of his own, he never proved himself in the Argentine Primera División as an upcoming player, achieving stardom overseas from a young age,[18][390] while his lack of outward passion for the Albiceleste shirt (until 2019 he did not sing the national anthem and is disinclined to emotional displays) have in the past led to the false perception that he felt Catalan rather than truly Argentine.[423] Football journalist Tim Vickery states the view among Argentines is that Messi "was always seen as more Catalan than one of them".[591] Despite having lived in Spain since age 13, Messi rejected the option of representing Spain internationally. He has said: "Argentina is my country, my family, my way of expressing myself. I would change all my records to make the people in my country happy."[592] Moreover, several pundits and footballing figures, including Maradona, questioned Messi's leadership with Argentina at times, despite his playing ability.[593][594][595] Vickery states the perception of Messi among Argentines changed in 2019, with Messi making a conscious effort to become "more one of the group, more Argentine", with Vickery adding that following the World Cup victory in 2022 Messi would now be held in the same esteem by his compatriots as Maradona.[591]

Comparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo
Main article: Messi–Ronaldo rivalry
Messi has been compared with Cristiano Ronaldo (left) throughout much of their careers.
Among his contemporary peers, Messi is most often compared and contrasted with Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo, as part of an ongoing rivalry that has been compared to past sports rivalries like the Muhammad Ali–Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Roger Federer–Rafael Nadal rivalry in tennis, and the Prost–Senna rivalry from Formula One motor racing.[596][597]
Although Messi has at times denied any rivalry,[598][599] they are widely believed to push one another in their aim to be the best player in the world.[154] Since 2008, Messi has won eight Ballons d'Or to Ronaldo's five,[600] seven FIFA World's Best Player awards to Ronaldo's five, and six European Golden Shoes to Ronaldo's four.[601] Pundits and fans regularly argue the individual merits of both players.[154][602] Beyond their playing styles, the debate also revolves around their differing physiques – Ronaldo is 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1⁄2 in) with a muscular build – and contrasting public personalities with Ronaldo's self-confidence and theatrics a foil to Messi's humility.[603][604][605] From 2009–10 to 2017–18, Messi faced Ronaldo at least twice every season in El Clásico, which ranks among the world's most viewed annual sports events.[606] Off the pitch, Ronaldo is his direct competitor in terms of salary, sponsorships, and social media fanbase.[606]
After Messi led Argentina to victory in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a number of football critics, commentators, and players have opined that Messi has settled the debate between the two players.[A]

In popular culture
Messi was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014; he was the first player to exceed the €40 million benchmark, with earnings of €41 million in 2013, and the €50–€60 million points, with income of €65 million in 2014.[159][610] Messi was second on Forbes list of the world's highest-paid athletes, after Ronaldo, with income of $81 million from salary and endorsements in 2015–16.[611] In 2018 he was the first player to exceed the €100m benchmark for a calendar year, with earnings of €126m ($154m) in combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements.[612] Forbes ranked him the world's highest-paid athlete in 2019.[613] From 2008, he was Barcelona's highest-paid player, receiving a salary that increased incrementally from €7.8 million to €13 million over the next five years.[83][84][140] Signing a new contract in 2017, he earned $667,000 per week in wages, and Barcelona paid him $60 million as a signing on bonus.[614] His buyout clause was set at $835 million (€700 million).[614] In 2020, Messi became the second footballer, as well as the second athlete in a team sport, after Ronaldo, to surpass $1 billion in earnings during their careers.[615]

Messi's Argentina jersey, supplied by Adidas, was sold out worldwide during the 2022 World Cup.[616]
In addition to salary and bonuses, much of his income derives from endorsements; SportsPro has consequently cited him as one of the world's most marketable athletes every year since their research began in 2010.[617] His main sponsor since 2006 is Adidas. As Barcelona's leading youth prospect, he was signed with Nike since age 14, but transferred to Adidas after they successfully challenged their rival's claim to his image rights in court.[618] Messi established himself as their leading brand endorser;[606] from 2008, he had a long-running signature collection of Adidas F50 boots, and in 2015, became the first footballer to receive his own sub-brand of Adidas boots, the Adidas Messi.[619][620] Since 2017, he has worn the latest version of the Adidas Nemeziz.[621] In 2015, a Barcelona jersey with Messi's name and number was the best-selling replica jersey worldwide.[622] At the 2022 World Cup, Adidas sold out of Messi's Argentina No.10 jersey worldwide.[616]

After blessing himself, Messi often celebrates a goal by pointing a finger on each hand towards the sky in dedication to his late grandmother.[623] His goal celebration features in the FIFA video game series, first appearing in FIFA 14.
As a commercial entity, Messi's brand has been based exclusively on his talents and achievements as a player, in contrast to arguably more glamorous players like Ronaldo and David Beckham. At the start of his career, he thus mainly held sponsorship contracts with companies that employ sports-oriented marketing, such as Adidas, Pepsi, and Konami.[624][625] From 2010, concurrently with increased achievements as a player, his marketing appeal widened, leading to long-term endorsement deals with luxury brands Dolce & Gabbana and Audemars Piguet.[624][626] Messi is a global brand ambassador for Gillette, Turkish Airlines, Ooredoo, and Tata Motors, among other companies.[627][628][629][630] Messi was the face of Konami's video game series Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of PES 2009, PES 2010, PES 2011 and PES 2020. He subsequently signed with rival company EA Sports to become the face of their series FIFA and appeared on consecutive covers from FIFA 13 to FIFA 16.[631][632]
Messi was among the Time 100, an annual list of the world's most influential people, in 2011, 2012 and 2023.[633][634][635] His fanbase on Facebook is among the largest of public figures: within seven hours of its launch in April 2011, Messi's Facebook page had nearly seven million followers, and by July 2023 he had over 114 million followers, the second highest for a sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo.[636][637] He has over 450 million Instagram followers, the second highest for an individual and sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo.[638] His World Cup celebration post from 18 December 2022 is the most liked post on Instagram with over 70 million likes.[639] According to a 2014 survey in 15 international markets, Messi was familiar to 87% of respondents around the world, of whom 78% perceived him favourably, making him the second-most recognised player globally, behind Ronaldo, and the most likable of all contemporary players.[640][641] On his economic impact on the city in which he plays, Terry Gibson called him a "tourist attraction".[642]

Madame Tussauds unveiled their first wax sculpture of Messi at Wembley Stadium in 2012.[643] A gold replica of his left foot, weighing 25 kg (55 lb) and valued at $5.3 million, went on sale in Japan in 2013 to raise funds for victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.[644] In 2013, a Turkish Airlines advertisement starring Messi, in which he engages in a selfie competition with Kobe Bryant, was the most-watched ad on YouTube in 2013, receiving 137 million views, and was voted the best advertisement of the 2005–15 decade to commemorate YouTube's founding.[645][646] World Press Photo selected "The Final Game", a photo of Messi facing the World Cup trophy after Argentina's final defeat to Germany, as the best sports image of 2014.[647] Messi, a documentary by filmmaker Álex de la Iglesia, premiered at the Venice Film Festival in August 2014.[648]
In June 2021, Messi signed a five-year deal to become an ambassador for the Hard Rock Cafe brand. He stated, "sports and music are an integral part of my life. It is an honor to be the first athlete to partner with a brand who has a history of teaming with music legends."[649] In May 2022, Messi was unveiled as Saudi Arabia's tourism ambassador. Due to Saudi Arabia's poor human rights record, Messi was condemned the role which was viewed as an attempt of Saudi sportswashing.[650][651] In April 2023, Messi was featured in the 200 year old Thrissur Pooram festival in Kerala, India.[652] During Thrissur Pooram, which is one of the largest festivals in Asia, umbrellas carrying the illuminated cut outs of Messi holding the World Cup trophy were displayed on the top of caparisoned elephants during the Kudamattam ceremony.[653]

Personal life
Family and relationships
Since 2008, Messi has been in a relationship with Antonela Roccuzzo, a fellow native of Rosario.[654] He has known Roccuzzo since he was five years old, as she is the cousin of his childhood best friend, Lucas Scaglia, who is also a football player.[655] After keeping their relationship private for a year, Messi first confirmed their romance in an interview in January 2009, before going public a month later during a carnival in Sitges after the Barcelona–Espanyol derby.[656]

Messi and Roccuzzo have three sons. To celebrate his partner's first pregnancy, Messi placed the ball under his shirt after scoring in Argentina's 4–0 win against Ecuador on 2 June 2012, before confirming the pregnancy in an interview two weeks later.[658] Thiago was born in Barcelona on 2 November 2012.[659] In April 2015, Messi confirmed that they were expecting another child.[660] On 30 June 2017, he married Roccuzzo at a luxury hotel named Hotel City Center in Rosario.[661] In October 2017, his wife announced they were expecting their third child.[662] Messi and his family are Catholic Christians.[663]
Messi enjoys a close relationship with his immediate family members, particularly his mother, Celia, whose face he has tattooed on his left shoulder. His professional affairs are largely run as a family business: his father, Jorge, has been his agent since he was 14, and his oldest brother, Rodrigo, handles his daily schedule and publicity. His mother and other brother, Matías, manage his charitable organization, the Leo Messi Foundation, and take care of personal and professional matters in Rosario.[664]
Since leaving for Spain aged 13, Messi has maintained close ties to his hometown of Rosario, even preserving his distinct Rosarino accent. He has kept ownership of his family's old house, although it has long stood empty; he maintains a penthouse apartment in an exclusive residential building for his mother, as well as a family compound just outside the city. Once when he was in training with the national team in Buenos Aires, he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and returned to Buenos Aires the next day in time for practice. Messi keeps in daily contact via phone and text with a small group of confidants in Rosario, most of whom were fellow members of "The Machine of '87" at Newell's Old Boys. While at Barcelona he lived in Castelldefels, a village near Barcelona. He was on bad terms with the club after his transfer to Barcelona, but by 2012 their public feud had ended, with Newell's embracing their ties with Messi, even issuing a club membership card to his newborn son.[18][665][666] Messi has long planned to return to Rosario to end his playing career at Newell's.[667] Messi holds triple citizenship, as he is a citizen of Argentina, Italy, and Spain.[668]

Philanthropy
Throughout his career, Messi has been involved in charitable efforts aimed at vulnerable children, a commitment that stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his own childhood. Since 2004, he has contributed his time and finances to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), an organisation with which Barcelona also have a strong association.[669][670] Messi has served as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador since his appointment in March 2010, completing his first field mission for the organisation four months later as he travelled to Haiti to bring public awareness to the plight of the country's children in the wake of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. He has since participated in UNICEF campaigns targeting HIV prevention, education, and the social inclusion of disabled children.[671] To celebrate his son's first birthday, in November 2013, Messi and Thiago were part of a publicity campaign to raise awareness of mortality rates among disadvantaged children.[672]

Messi (pictured in 2007) has worked with UNICEF since 2004 and has served as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador since 2010.
In addition to his work with UNICEF, Messi founded his own charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, which supports access to health care, education, and sport for children.[673] It was established in 2007 following a visit Messi paid to a hospital for terminally ill children in Boston, an experience that resonated with him to the point that he decided to reinvest part of his earnings into society.[665] Through his foundation, Messi has awarded research grants, financed medical training, and invested in the development of medical centres and projects in Argentina, Spain, and elsewhere in the world.[665][674] In addition to his own fundraising activities, such as his global "Messi and Friends" football matches, his foundation receives financial support from various companies to which he has assigned his name in endorsement agreements, with Adidas as their main sponsor.[675][676]
Messi has also invested in youth football in Argentina: he financially supports Sarmiento, a football club based in the Rosario neighbourhood where he was born, committing in 2013 to the refurbishment of their facilities and the installation of all-weather pitches, and funds the management of several youth players at Newell's Old Boys and rival club Rosario Central, as well as at River Plate and Boca Juniors in Buenos Aires.[665] At Newell's Old Boys, his boyhood club, he funded the 2012 construction of a new gymnasium and a dormitory inside the club's stadium for their youth academy. His former youth coach at Newell's, Ernesto Vecchio, is employed by the Leo Messi Foundation as a talent scout for young players.[18] On 7 June 2016, Messi won a libel case against La Razón newspaper and was awarded €65,000 in damages, which he donated to the charity Médecins Sans Frontières.[677] Messi made a donation worth €1 million ($1.1 million) to fight the spread of coronavirus.[678] This was split between Clinic Barcelona hospital in Barcelona, Spain and his native Argentina.[679] In addition to this, Messi along with his fellow FC Barcelona teammates announced he will be taking a 70% cut in salaries during the 2020 coronavirus emergency, and contribute further to the club to provide fully to salaries of all the clubs employees.[680]
In November 2016, with the Argentine Football Association being run by a FIFA committee for emergency due to an economic crisis, it was reported that three of the national team's security staff told Messi that they had not received their salaries for six months. He stepped in and paid the salaries of the three members.[681][682] In February 2021, Messi donated to the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya his Adidas shoes which he wore when he scored his 644th goal for Barcelona and broke Pelé's record for most goals scored for a single club; the shoes were later auctioned off in April by the museum for charity to help children with cancer and were sold for £125,000.[683]
In advance of the 2021 Copa América in Uruguay, Messi donated three signed shirts to the Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech—whose directors spoke of their admiration for Messi—in order to secure 50,000 doses of Sinovac's COVID-19 vaccine, CoronaVac, in the hope of vaccinating all of South America's football players.[684] A deal brokered by Uruguay's president Luis Lacalle Pou, the plan to prioritise football players caused some controversy given widespread vaccine scarcity in the region, with the Mayor of Canelones Yamandú Orsi remarking that "Just as the president manifested cooperation with CONMEBOL to vaccinate for the Copa América, he could just as well have the same consideration for Canelones".[684]

Tax fraud
Messi's financial affairs came under investigation in 2013 for suspected tax evasion. Offshore companies in tax havens Uruguay and Belize were used to evade €4.1 million in taxes related to sponsorship earnings between 2007 and 2009. An unrelated shell company in Panama set up in 2012 was subsequently identified as belonging to the Messis in the Panama Papers data leak. Messi, who pleaded ignorance of the alleged scheme, voluntarily paid arrears of €5.1 million in August 2013. On 6 July 2016, Messi and his father were both found guilty of tax fraud and were handed suspended 21-month prison sentences and respectively ordered to pay €1.7 million and €1.4 million in fines.[685] Facing the judge, he said, "I just played football. I signed the contracts because I trusted my dad and the lawyers and we had decided that they would take charge of those things."[686]

Notes

^ Citations:[607][608][609]



^ According to FCBarcelona.com, and his authorised biography, Messi by Guillem Balagué, his surname is the single "Messi", in accordance with Argentine customs.[2][3] Other sources, including a 2014 document by FIFA, give his surname as the double "Messi Cuccittini".[4] After winning a libel case in 2017, Messi's own management company stated: "The football player Lionel Andres Messi Cuccittini has donated a total of €72,783.20 to the organisation Doctors Without Borders."[5]

^ Messi received France Football's 2009 Ballon d'Or and FIFA's 2009 FIFA World Player of the Year award, prior to their six-year merger; he proceeded to win the newly formed award, the FIFA Ballon d'Or, four times—2010, 2011, 2012, 2015. Both organisations credited him with five (FIFA) Ballon d'Or awards.[6][7] He then went on to win the Ballon d'Or three more times—2019, 2021, 2023—again assigned by the sole France Football, and won the newly established The Best FIFA Men's Player three times as well—2019, 2022, 2023. France Football recognizes him as a record eight-time Ballon d'Or winner and FIFA recognizes him as a record eight-time world's best player.[8][9]

^ a b Messi missed the 2006 UEFA Champions League final through injury, but received a winners medal having been part of the Barcelona squad for the 2005–06 Champions League season.[10] The official UEFA website states "several other players have four titles to their name but only three final appearances: Lionel Messi: 2006*, 2009, 2011, 2015 (Barcelona)".[11]

^ Assist statistics began in 1990.

^ According to Bleacher Report's Richard Fitzpatrick, "Schwarzstein and Messi built up a close relationship during more than four years of treatment."[657]



^ a b Does not include an unofficial friendly match played on 24 May 2008 in Barcelona between Argentina U23 and the Catalonia national football team,[697][698] as Catalonia is not affiliated with either FIFA or UEFA as a national member association and is therefore not allowed to participate in official competitions.[699]

Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH ComM (Portuguese pronunciation: [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaldu]; born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr and the Portugal national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards,[note 3] a record three UEFA Men's Player of the Year Awards, and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 33 trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, the UEFA European Championship and the UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances (183), goals (140) and assists (42) in the Champions League, goals in the European Championship (14), international goals (128) and international appearances (205). He is one of the few players to have made over 1,200 professional career appearances, the most by an outfield player, and has scored over 850 official senior career goals for club and country, making him the top goalscorer of all time.
Ronaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, winning the FA Cup in his first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth €94 million (£80 million). He became a key contributor and formed an attacking trio with Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale which was integral to the team winning four Champions Leagues from 2014 to 2018, including La Décima. During this period, he won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. He also became the club's all-time top goalscorer and the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, and finished as the competition's top scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2018. With Real, Ronaldo won four Champions Leagues, two La Liga titles, two Copas del Rey, two UEFA Super Cups and three Club World Cups. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million), the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppa Italiana trophies and a Coppa Italia, became the inaugural Serie A Most Valuable Player and became the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues. He returned to Manchester United in 2021, finishing his only full season as the club's top scorer, before his contract was terminated in 2022. In 2023, he signed for Al Nassr.
Ronaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has since earned more than 200 caps, making him both the country and history's most-capped player of all time, recognised by the Guinness World Records.[9] With more than 100 goals at international level, he is also the sports all-time top goalscorer. Ronaldo has played in and scored at eleven major tournaments; he scored his first international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He assumed captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. This achievement would see him receive his fourth Ballon d'Or. He also led them to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award in the finals, and later received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020.
One of the world's most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2016, 2017, and 2023, and the world's most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019. Time included him on their list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2014. He is the first footballer and the third sportsman to earn US$1 billion in his career.


Early life
Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on 5 February 1985 in the São Pedro parish of Funchal, the capital of the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in the nearby parish of Santo António.[10][11] He is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros da Aveiro, who worked as a cook in the hospitality industry and a cleaning woman,[12][13] and José Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener at the Junta de Freguesia of Santo António and part-time kit man for football club Andorinha.[14][15][16] His great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel da Piedade, an African woman, was born in the island of São Vicente, in what was then Portuguese Cape Verde, and moved to Madeira Island at 16.[17][18] He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia "Katia".[19] He was named after actor and U.S. President Ronald Reagan, whom his father was a fan of.[20] His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism, and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to perform the procedure,[21][22] as abortions were illegal in Portugal at that time.[23] Ronaldo grew up in an impoverished Roman Catholic home, sharing a room with all his siblings.[24]
As a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995,[25] where his father was the kit man,[14] and later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him for a fee of £1,500.[26] He subsequently moved from Madeira to Lisbon to join Sporting CP's youth system.[26] By age 14, while struggling with his school duties and responsibilities in Escola EB2 de Telheiras, his school in the Telheiras area of Lisbon, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and agreed with his mother and his tutor at Sporting CP, Leonel Pontes,[27] to cease his education to focus entirely on football.[28][29] With a troubled life as a student[30] and living in Lisbon area away from his Madeiran family, he did not complete schooling beyond the 6th grade.[31][32] While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had "disrespected" him.[28] One year later, he was diagnosed with tachycardia, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football.[33] Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate.[34] He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later.[35] In 2021, Cristiano Ronaldo's mother, Dolores Aveiro, stated in an interview for Sporting CP's official television channel (Sporting TV) that her son would be a bricklayer if he hadn't become a professional football player.[36]

Club career
Sporting CP

At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager László Bölöni, who was impressed with his dribbling.[37] He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a single season.[26]
On 14 August 2002,[38] Cristiano Ronaldo, then 17, played his first official match for a Sporting CP's senior team, in a UEFA Champions League qualifying round at José Alvalade Stadium against Inter Milan. He came on in the 58th[38] minute in place of Toñito.[39][40]
As far as the Portuguese football league system's competitions is concerned, Sporting CP B was the 1st team in his senior career playing domestically, where he debuted in a 2–1 away loss against Sport Clube Lusitânia on 1 September 2002, in a game for the Segunda Divisão B championship played in the Azores.[41] On 29 September 2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, playing for Sporting CP's main team against Braga, and on 7 October, he scored two goals against Moreirense in their 3–0 win.[42] Over the course of the 2002–03 season, his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta.[43] Manager Arsène Wenger, who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at Arsenal's stadium in November to discuss a possible transfer.[44]
Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently, after Sporting defeated United 3–1 at the inauguration of the Estádio José Alvalade on 6 August 2003. Initially, United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a year.[45] Having been impressed by him, the United players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson agreed to pay Sporting £12.24 million[45] for what he considered to be "one of the most exciting young players" he had ever seen.[46] A decade after his departure from the club, in 2013, Sporting honoured Ronaldo by selecting him to become their 100,000th member.[47]

Manchester United
2003–2007: Development and breakthrough


"There have been a few players described as 'the new George Best' over the years, but this is the first time it's been a compliment to me."


—Former Manchester United player George Best hails the 18-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo in 2003.[48]

Ronaldo's move to Manchester United was completed on 12 August 2003, too late for the 2003 FA Community Shield but in time for their game against Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2003–04 season, and made him the first Portuguese player to sign for the club.[49] His transfer fee made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history.[50] Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham.[51] Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo.[52] A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said: "He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career."[53]

Ronaldo playing for Manchester United against Chelsea during the 2005–06 Premier League season
Ronaldo made his debut as a substitute in a 4–0 home win over Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League on 16 August 2003, and received a standing ovation when he came on for Nicky Butt.[54] His performance earned praise from Best, who hailed it as "undoubtedly the most exciting debut" he had ever seen.[48] Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free-kick in a 3–0 win over Portsmouth on 1 November.[55] Three more league goals followed in the second half of the campaign,[56] the last of which came against Aston Villa on the final day of the season, a match in which he also received the first red card of his career.[57] Ronaldo ended his first season in English football by scoring the opening goal in United's 3–0 win over Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final, earning his first trophy.[58] BBC pundit Alan Hansen described him as the star of the final.[59] The British press had been critical of Ronaldo during the season for his "elaborate" step-overs in trying to beat opponents,[60] but teammate Gary Neville said he was "not a show pony, but the real thing", and predicted he would become a world-class player.[61]



"He has got the tricks and party pieces, we know that, but they're not much good unless there is something at the end of it all. We still have to remember, of course, that the lad is only 19 years of age. Considering that, you have to say he has got massive talent. His feet are mesmerising at times, and if he can couple that with some consistently good crossing, the future looks frightening."


—Former BBC pundit Alan Hansen commenting on Ronaldo after his first season.[59]

Ronaldo scored United's 1,000th Premier League goal on 29 October 2004, their only goal in a 4–1 loss to Middlesbrough.[62] A few weeks later, he signed a new contract with the club that extended his previous deal by two years to 2010.[63] At the start of 2005, Ronaldo played two of his best matches of the 2004–05 season, producing a goal and an assist against Aston Villa and scoring twice against rivals Arsenal.[64][65] He played the full 120 minutes of the 2005 FA Cup Final against Arsenal, which ended in a goalless draw; although Ronaldo scored his attempt in the penalty shoot-out, United lost 5–4.[66] Ronaldo won his second trophy in English football, the Football League Cup, after scoring the third goal in United's 4–0 final win over Wigan Athletic.[67]
During his third season in England, Ronaldo was involved in several incidents. He had a one-match ban imposed on him by UEFA for a "one-fingered gesture" towards Benfica fans,[68] and was sent off in the Manchester derby (a 3–1 defeat) for kicking Manchester City's former United player Andy Cole.[69] Ronaldo clashed with a teammate, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who took offence at the winger's showboating style of play.[70] Following the 2006 FIFA World Cup, in which he was involved in an incident where club teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off,[71] Ronaldo publicly asked for a transfer, lamenting the lack of support he felt he had received from the club over the incident.[72] United denied the possibility of him leaving the club.[73]
Although his World Cup altercation with Rooney resulted in Ronaldo being booed throughout the 2006–07 season,[74] it proved to be his break-out year, as he broke the 20-goal barrier for the first time and won his first Premier League title. An important factor in this success was his one-to-one training by first-team coach René Meulensteen, who taught him to make himself more unpredictable, improve his teamwork, call for the ball and capitalise on goalscoring opportunities rather than waiting for the chance to score the aesthetically pleasing goals for which he was already known.[75] He scored three consecutive braces at the end of December, against Aston Villa (a win that put United on top of the league), Wigan and Reading.[76][77][78] Ronaldo was named the Premier League Player of the Month in November and December, becoming only the third player to receive consecutive honours.[79]

2007–2008: Collective and individual success
Ronaldo playing for Manchester United during the 2006–07 Premier League season
At the quarter-final stage of the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League, Ronaldo scored his first goals in his 30th match in the competition,[80] scoring twice in a 7–1 win over Roma.[81] He subsequently scored four minutes into the first semi-final leg against Milan, which ended in a 3–2 win,[82] but was marked out of the second leg as United lost 3–0 at the San Siro.[83] He also helped United reach the 2007 FA Cup Final, but the final against Chelsea ended in a 1–0 defeat.[84] Ronaldo scored the only goal in the Manchester derby on 5 May (his 50th goal for the club), as United won their first league title in four years.[85] As a result of his performances, he amassed a host of personal awards for the season. He won the Professional Footballers' Association's Player's Player, Fans' Player and Young Player of the Year awards, as well as the Football Writers' Association's Footballer of the Year award,[86][87] becoming the first player to win all four main PFA and FWA honours.[88] His wages were raised to £120,000 a week as part of a five-year contract extension.[89] Ronaldo was named runner-up to Kaká for the 2007 Ballon d'Or,[90] and came third, behind Kaká and Lionel Messi, in the running for the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year award.[91]
Ronaldo scored his first hat-trick for United in a 6–0 win against Newcastle United on 12 January 2008, which put United top of the league table.[92] On 19 March, he captained United for the first time in a home win over Bolton and scored both goals in a 2–0 win.[93] His second goal was his 33rd of the campaign, surpassing George Best's total of 32 goals in the 1967–68 season, setting the club's new single-season record by a midfielder.[94] His 31 league goals earned him the Premier League Golden Boot,[95] as well as the European Golden Shoe, which made him the first winger to win the latter award.[96] He additionally received the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year awards for the second consecutive season.[97][98] In the knockout stage of the Champions League, Ronaldo scored the decisive goal against Lyon to help United advance to the quarter-finals 2–1 on aggregate;[99] while playing as a striker, he scored with a header in the 3–0 aggregate win over Roma.[100] United reached the final against Chelsea in Moscow on 21 May, where, despite his opening goal being negated by an equaliser and his penalty kick being saved in the shoot-out,[101] United emerged victorious 1–1, winning the penalties 6–5.[102][103] As the Champions League top scorer, Ronaldo was named the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year.[104]
Ronaldo scored a total of 42 goals in all competitions during the 2007–08 season, his most prolific campaign during his time in England. He missed three matches after headbutting a Portsmouth player at the start of the season, an experience he said taught him not to let opponents provoke him.[105] As rumours circulated of Ronaldo's interest in moving to Real Madrid, United filed a tampering complaint with governing body FIFA over Madrid's alleged pursuit of their player, but they declined to take action.[106] FIFA president Sepp Blatter asserted that the player should be allowed to leave his club, describing the situation as "modern slavery".[107] Despite Ronaldo publicly agreeing with Blatter,[108] he remained at United for another year.[109]

Ahead of the 2008–09 season, on 7 July, Ronaldo underwent ankle surgery,[110] which kept him out of action for 10 weeks.[111] Following his return, he scored his 100th goal in all competitions for United with the first of two free kicks in a 5–0 win against Stoke City on 15 November,[112] which meant he had now scored against all 19 opposition teams in the Premier League at the time.[113] At the close of 2008, Ronaldo helped United win the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup in Japan,[114] assisting the final-winning goal against Liga de Quito and winning the Silver Ball in the process.[115] With his 2008 Ballon d'Or and 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year, Ronaldo became United's first Ballon d'Or winner since Best in 1968,[116] and the first Premier League player to be named the FIFA World Player of the Year.[117]
His match-winning goal in the second leg against Porto, a 40-yard strike, earned him the inaugural FIFA Puskás Award, presented by FIFA in recognition of the best goal of the year;[118] he later called it the best goal he had ever scored.[119] United advanced to the final in Rome,[120] where he made little impact in United's 2–0 defeat to Barcelona.[121] Ronaldo ended his time in England with nine trophies, as United claimed their third successive league title and a Football League Cup.[122][123] He finished the campaign with 26 goals in all competitions, 16 goals fewer than the previous season, in four more appearances.[124] His final goal for United came on 10 May 2009 with a free kick in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford.[125]

Real Madrid
As his usual number 7 was unavailable, Ronaldo wore number 9 during his debut season at Madrid. After Raúl departed the club, Ronaldo was handed the number 7 shirt before the 2010–11 season.
Ahead of the 2009–10 season, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time of £80 million (€94 million).[126] His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth €11 million per year and contained a €1 billion buy-out clause.[127] At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli.[128] Since club captain Raúl already wore the number 7 (the number Ronaldo wore at United), Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt,[129] which was presented to him by former Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano.[130]

2009–2013: World record transfer and La Liga title
Ronaldo made his La Liga debut against Deportivo La Coruña on 29 August, scoring a penalty in a 3–2 home win.[131] He scored in each of his first four league games, the first Madrid player to do so.[132] His first Champions League goals for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match against Zürich.[133] His strong start to the season was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in October while on international duty, which kept him sidelined for seven weeks.[134][135] A week after his return, he received his first red card in Spain in a match against Almería.[136] Midway through the season, Ronaldo finished second in the 2009 Ballon d'Or and the 2009 FIFA World Player of the Year awards, behind Messi. He finished the season with 33 goals in all competitions, including a hat-trick in a 4–1 win against Mallorca on 5 May 2010, his first in La Liga,[137][138] and became Real Madrid's highest goalscorer that season. Although Ronaldo helped amass a club record 96 points in the league, he did not win a trophy in his first season.[139][140]
Following Raúl's departure, Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt for Madrid before the 2010–11 season.[141] His subsequent return to his Ballon d'Or-winning form was epitomised when, for the first time in his career, he scored four goals in a single match during a 6–1 rout against Racing Santander on 23 October.[142] Ronaldo subsequently scored further hat-tricks against Athletic Bilbao, Levante, Villarreal and Málaga.[143][144][145] Despite his performances, he did not make the top three in the inaugural 2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or.[146] During a historic series of four Clásicos against rivals Barcelona in April 2011, Ronaldo scored twice to equal his personal record of 42 goals in all competitions. Though he failed to score in either leg of the Champions League semi-finals as Madrid were eliminated, he equalised from the penalty spot in the return league game and scored the match-winning goal in the 103rd minute of the 2011 Copa del Rey Final, winning his first trophy in Spain.[147][148] His two goals in the last match of the season against Almería made him the first player in La Liga to score 40 goals.[149] In addition to the Pichichi Trophy, Ronaldo won the European Golden Shoe for a second time, becoming the first player to win the award in different leagues.[150]

Ronaldo scored 46 league goals during the La Liga championship success in his third season in Spain.
During the following season, Ronaldo achieved a new personal best of 60 goals in all competitions.[151] He finished as runner-up to Messi for the 2011 FIFA Ballon d'Or, after scoring hat-tricks against Real Zaragoza, Rayo Vallecano, Málaga, Osasuna and Sevilla, the last of which put Madrid on top of the league by the season's midway point.[152][153][154] Ronaldo found greater team success in the league, helping Madrid win their first league title in four years with a record 100 points. Following a hat-trick against Levante as Madrid further increased their lead over Barcelona,[155] he scored his 100th league goal for Madrid in a 5–1 win over Real Sociedad on 24 March 2012, a milestone he reached in just 92 matches across three seasons, breaking the previous club record held by Ferenc Puskás.[156] Another hat-trick in the Madrid derby against Atlético Madrid brought his total to 40 league goals, equalling his record of the previous season.[157] His final league goal of the season, against Mallorca, took his total to 46 goals, four short of the new record set by Messi,[158] though he became the first player to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single La Liga season.[159]
Ronaldo began the 2012–13 season by lifting the 2012 Supercopa de España, his third trophy in Spain. With a goal in each leg, he helped Madrid win the Spanish Super Cup on away goals following a 4–4 aggregate draw against Barcelona.[160] Although Ronaldo publicly commented that he was unhappy with a "professional issue" within the club, prompted by his refusal to celebrate his 150th goal for Madrid,[161] his goalscoring rate did not suffer. After netting a hat-trick, including two penalties, against Deportivo, he scored his first hat-trick in the Champions League in a 4–1 win over Ajax.[162] Four days later, he became the first player to score in six successive Clásicos when he hit a brace in a 2–2 draw at Camp Nou.[163] His performances again saw Ronaldo voted second in the running for the 2012 FIFA Ballon d'Or, behind four-time winner Messi.[164]

2013–2015: Consecutive Ballon d'Or wins and La Décima
Following the 2012–13 winter break, Ronaldo captained Madrid for the first time in an official match, scoring twice to lift 10-man Madrid to a 4–3 win over Sociedad on 6 January.[165] He subsequently became the first non-Spanish player in 60 years to captain Madrid in El Clasico on 30 January, a match which also marked his 500th club appearance.[166] Three days prior, he had scored his 300th club goal as part of a perfect hat-trick against Getafe.[167] He scored his 200th goal for Madrid on 8 May in a 6–2 win against Málaga, reaching the landmark in 197 games.[168] He helped Madrid reach the 2013 Copa del Rey Final by scoring twice in El Clásico, which marked the sixth successive match at Camp Nou in which he had scored,[169] a club record.[160] In the final, he headed the opening goal of an eventual 2–1 extra time defeat to Atlético, but was shown a red card for violent conduct.[170] In the first knockout round of the Champions League, Ronaldo faced his former club Manchester United for the first time. After scoring the equaliser in a 1–1 draw at home,[171] he scored the winning goal in a 2–1 win on his first return to Old Trafford.[172] He did not celebrate scoring against his former club as a mark of respect.[173] After scoring three goals against Galatasaray in the quarters, he scored Madrid's only goal in the 4–1 away defeat to Borussia Dortmund in the semi-finals and Real were eliminated at the semi-final stage for the third consecutive year despite a 2–0 win in the second leg.[174]

Ronaldo scored a record 17 UEFA Champions League goals during the 2013–14 season en route to La Décima.
At the start of the 2013–14 season, Ronaldo signed a new contract that extended his stay by three years to 2018, with a salary of €17 million net, making him briefly the highest-paid player in football.[175] He was joined at the club by winger Gareth Bale, whose world record transfer fee of €100 million surpassed the fee Madrid had paid for Ronaldo four years prior.[176] Together with striker Karim Benzema, they formed an attacking trio popularly dubbed "BBC", an acronym of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, and a play on the name of the British public service broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).[177] By late November, Ronaldo had scored 32 goals from 22 matches for both club and country, including hat-tricks against Galatasaray, Sevilla, Real Sociedad, Northern Ireland, and Sweden.[178][179][180] He ended 2013 with 69 goals in 59 appearances, his highest year-end goal tally.[181] He received the 2013 FIFA Ballon d'Or, an amalgamation of the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, for the first time in his career.[182]
Concurrently with his individual achievements, Ronaldo enjoyed his greatest team success in Spain to date, as he helped Madrid win La Décima, their tenth European Cup. His goal in a 3–0 home win over Dortmund (his 100th Champions League match) took his total for the season to 14 goals, equalling the record Messi had set two years before.[183] After hitting a brace in a 4–0 defeat of Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena,[184] he scored from the penalty spot in the 120th minute of the 4–1 final win over Atlético, becoming the first player to score in two European Cup finals for two different winning teams.[185] His overall performance in the final was subdued as a result of patellar tendinitis and related hamstring problems, which had plagued him in the last months of the campaign. Ronaldo played the final against medical advice, later commenting: "In your life you do not win without sacrifices and you must take risks".[186] As the competition's top goalscorer for the third time, with a record 17 goals,[187] he was named the UEFA Best Player in Europe.[188]
In the Copa del Rey, Ronaldo helped Madrid reach the final by scoring two penalties against Atlético at the Vicente Calderón,[189] the first of which meant he had now scored in every single minute of a 90-minute football match.[190] His continued issues with his knee and thigh caused him to miss the final, where Madrid defeated Barcelona 2–1 to claim the trophy.[191] Ronaldo scored 31 goals in 30 league games, which earned him the Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe, receiving the latter award jointly with Liverpool striker Luis Suárez.[192] Among his haul was his 400th career goal, in 653 appearances for club and country, which came with a brace against Celta Vigo on 6 January; he dedicated his goals to compatriot Eusébio, who had died two days before.[193] A last-minute, back-heeled volley scored against Valencia on 4 May (his 50th goal in all competitions) was recognised as the best goal of the season by the Liga Nacional de Fútbol Profesional,[194] which additionally named Ronaldo the Best Player in La Liga.[195]

During the 2014–15 season Ronaldo scored a personal best of 61 goals in all competitions.
During the 2014–15 season, Ronaldo set a new personal best of 61 goals, starting with both goals in Madrid's 2–0 win over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup.[196] He subsequently achieved his best-ever goalscoring start to a league campaign, with 15 goals in the first eight rounds.[197] His record 23rd La Liga hat-trick, scored against Celta Vigo on 6 December, made him the fastest player to reach 200 goals in La Liga, reaching the milestone in 178th matches.[197][198] After winning the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup,[199] Ronaldo received the 2014 Ballon d'Or,[200] joining Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini and Marco van Basten as a three-time recipient.[201] Madrid finished in second place in La Liga and exited at the semi-final stage in the Champions League.[202] In the latter competition, Ronaldo extended his run of scoring away to a record 12 matches with his strike in a 2–0 win against Schalke 04.[203] He scored both of his side's goals in the semi-finals against Juventus, where Madrid were eliminated 3–2 on aggregate.[204] With 10 goals, he finished as top scorer for a third consecutive season, alongside Messi and Neymar.[205] On 5 April, he scored five goals in a game for the first time in his career, including an eight-minute hat-trick, in a 9–1 rout of Granada.[206] His 300th goal for his club followed three days later in a 2–0 win against Rayo Vallecano.[207] Subsequent hat-tricks against Sevilla, Espanyol and Getafe took his number of hat-tricks for Madrid to 31, surpassing Di Stéfano's club record of 28.[196] He finished the season with 48 goals, winning a second consecutive Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe for a record fourth time.[196]

2015–2017: All-time Madrid top scorer
At the start of his seventh season at Madrid, the 2015–16 campaign, Ronaldo became the club's all-time top scorer, first in the league and then in all competitions. His five-goal haul in a 6–0 away win over Espanyol on 12 September took his tally in La Liga to 230 goals in 203 games, surpassing the club's previous record holder, Raúl.[208] A month later, on 17 October, he again surpassed Raúl when he scored the second goal in a 3–0 defeat of Levante at the Bernabéu to take his overall total for the club to 324 goals.[note 4] Ronaldo also became the all-time top scorer in the Champions League with a hat-trick in the first group match against Shakhtar Donetsk, having finished the previous season level with Messi on 77 goals.[210] Two goals against Malmö FF in a 2–0 away win on 30 September saw him reach the milestone of 500 career goals for club and country.[211] He subsequently became the first player to score double figures in the competition's group stage, setting the record at 11 goals, including another four-goal haul against Malmö.[212]

By March 2016, Ronaldo had scored 252 goals in 228 matches in La Liga to become the competition's second-highest goalscorer.
Ronaldo's four goals in a 7–1 home win over Celta de Vigo on 5 March 2016 took his total to 252 goals in La Liga, becoming the competition's second-highest scorer in history behind Messi.[213] He scored a hat-trick against VfL Wolfsburg to send his club into the Champions League semi-finals.[214] The treble took his tally in the competition to 16 goals, making him the top scorer for the fourth consecutive season and the fifth overall.[215] Suffering apparent fitness issues, Ronaldo gave a poorly-received performance in the final against Atlético, in a repeat of the 2014 final, though his penalty in the subsequent shoot-out secured Madrid's 11th victory.[216] For the sixth successive year, he ended the season having scored over 50 goals across all competitions.[216] For his efforts during the season, he received the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award for a second time.[217]
Ronaldo missed Madrid's first three matches of the 2016–17 season, including the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, as he continued to rehabilitate the knee injury he suffered against France in the Euro 2016 final.[218] On 15 September, he did not celebrate his late free kick equaliser against Sporting CP in the Champions League, with Ronaldo stating post match that "they made me who I am".[219] On 7 November, his contract was updated for the second time and extended by three years to 2021.[220] On 19 November, he scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 away win against Atlético, making him the all-time top scorer in the Madrid derby with 18 goals.[221] On 15 December, Ronaldo scored his 500th club career goal in the 2–0 win over Club América in the semi-finals of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup.[222] He then scored a hat-trick in the 4–2 win over Japanese club Kashima Antlers in the final.[223] Ronaldo finished the tournament as top scorer with four goals and was also named player of the tournament.[224] He won the 2016 Ballon d'Or, his fourth, and the inaugural 2016 The Best FIFA Men's Player, a revival of the former FIFA World Player of the Year, largely owing to his success with Portugal in winning Euro 2016.[225]

In the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League quarter-finals against Bayern in April, Ronaldo scored both goals in a 2–1 away win which saw him make history by becoming the first player to reach 100 goals in UEFA club competition.[226] In the second leg of the quarter-finals, Ronaldo scored a 'perfect' hat-trick and reached his 100th Champions League goal, becoming the first player to do so as Madrid again defeated Bayern 4–2 after extra-time.[227] On 2 May, Ronaldo scored another hat-trick as Madrid defeated Atlético 3–0 in the Champions League semi-final first leg.

2017–2018: Fifth Ballon d'Or and fifth Champions League win
At the start of the 2017–18 season, Ronaldo scored Madrid's second goal in the 80th minute of a 3–1 win over Barcelona in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de España at Camp Nou; however, he was sent off two minutes later and missed the second leg.[232] On 23 October, his performances throughout 2017 saw him awarded The Best FIFA Men's Player award for the second consecutive year.[233] On 6 December, he became the first player to score in all six Champions League group stage matches with a curling strike at home to Dortmund.[234] A day later, Ronaldo won the 2017 Ballon d'Or, receiving his fifth-time award on the Eiffel Tower in Paris.[235] On 16 December, he scored a free kick winner, as Madrid won their second Club World Cup in a row by beating Grêmio in the final.[236] On 3 March 2018, he scored two goals in a 3–1 home win over Getafe, his first being his 300th La Liga goal in his 286th appearance, making him the fastest player to reach this landmark and only the second player to do so after Messi.[237] On 18 March, he reached his 50th career hat-trick, scoring four goals in a 6–3 win against Girona.[238]

Ronaldo in the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final, his final game for Real Madrid
On 3 April, Ronaldo scored the first two goals in a 3–0 away win against Juventus in the quarter-finals of the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, with his second goal being an acrobatic bicycle kick. Described as a "PlayStation goal" by Juventus defender Andrea Barzagli, with Ronaldo's foot approximately 7 ft 7 in (2.31 m) off the ground, it garnered him a standing ovation from the opposing fans in the stadium as well as a plethora of plaudits from peers, pundits and coaches.[239] On 11 April, he scored in the second leg at home to Juventus, a 98th-minute injury time penalty in a 3–1 defeat, meaning Madrid advanced 4–3 on aggregate.[240] It was his tenth goal against Juventus, a Champions League record against a single club.[241] In the final on 26 May, Madrid defeated Liverpool 3–1, winning Ronaldo his fifth Champions League title, the first player to do so.[242] He finished as the top scorer of the tournament for the sixth consecutive season with 15 goals.[243] After the final, Ronaldo referred to his time with Madrid in the past tense, sparking speculation that he could leave the club.[244]

Juventus
Despite months of negotiation to sign a new Real Madrid contract,[245] on 10 July 2018, Ronaldo signed a four-year contract with Italian club Juventus after completing a €100 million transfer, which included an additional €12 million in other fees and solidarity contributions to Ronaldo's youth clubs.[246] The transfer was the highest ever for a player over 30 years old,[247] and the highest paid by an Italian club.[248] Upon signing, Ronaldo cited his need for a new challenge as his rationale for departing Madrid,[249] but later attributed the transfer to the lack of support he felt was shown by club president Florentino Pérez.[250]

2018–2020: Consecutive Serie A titles
On 18 August, Ronaldo made his debut in a 3–2 away win against Chievo Verona.[251] On 16 September, Ronaldo scored his first two goals for Juventus in his fourth appearance in a 2–1 home win over Sassuolo in Serie A; his second was the 400th league goal of his career.[252] On 19 September, in his first Champions League match for Juventus, against Valencia, he was sent off in the 29th minute for "violent conduct", his first red card in 154 tournament appearances.[253] Ronaldo became the first player in history to win 100 Champions League matches, setting up Mario Mandžukić's winner in a 1–0 home win over Valencia, which sealed Juventus's passage to the knock-out stages of the competition.[254] In December, he scored his tenth league goal of the season, from the penalty spot, the third in a 3–0 away win over Fiorentina.[255] After placing second in both the UEFA Men's Player of the Year and The Best FIFA Men's Player for the first time in three years, behind Luka Modrić, Ronaldo performances in 2018 also saw him voted runner-up for the 2018 Ballon d'Or, finishing once again behind his former teammate.[256] Ronaldo won his first trophy with the club on 16 January 2019, the 2018 Supercoppa Italiana, after he scored the only goal from a header against AC Milan.[257]

He became the second-fastest player to reach this landmark, after Gunnar Nordahl, and the first player in history to reach 50 goals in the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A, and becoming the second player after Edin Džeko to score 50 goals in three of Europe's top five major leagues.[276] With his brace, he also reached 30 league goals for the season, becoming just the third player (after Felice Borel in 1934 and John Hansen in 1952) in Juventus's history to reach that milestone in a season.[277][278] Moreover, he became the oldest player, at the age of 35 years and 166 days, to score over 30 goals in one of the five top European leagues since Ronnie Rooke with Arsenal in 1948.[279] On 26 July, Ronaldo scored the opening goal in a 2–0 home win over Sampdoria as Juventus were crowned Serie A champions for a ninth consecutive time.[280] He finished his second league campaign with 31 goals, making him the second-highest goalscorer in the league behind only European Golden Shoe winner Ciro Immobile, with 36 goals.[281][282] On 7 August, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 2–1 home win against Lyon in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16, which saw him finish the season with 37 goals in all competitions; the tally allowed him to break Borel's club record of 36 goals in a single season.[283] Despite the win, the tie finished 2–2 on aggregate and Juventus were eliminated from the competition on the away goals rule.[284]

On 22 August, Ronaldo started the first game of the new season on the bench, coming on as a substitute for Álvaro Morata in a 2–2 draw against Udinese, scoring a goal that was ruled out by VAR.[295] Though manager Massimiliano Allegri confirmed it was his decision due to Ronaldo's fitness, it came amid reports Ronaldo would depart the club before the closure of the transfer window,[296] and Ronaldo would tell Allegri he had "no intention" of remaining a Juventus player.[297] On 26 August, Ronaldo and his agent Jorge Mendes reached a verbal agreement with Manchester City over personal terms,[298] but the club pulled out of the deal the following day due to the overall cost of the transfer.[299] On the same day, it was confirmed that City's rivals Manchester United, Ronaldo's former club, were in advanced talks to sign him,[300][301] while former manager Alex Ferguson and several ex-teammates had been in contact to persuade him to re-sign for United.[302][303]

The following month, after enduring a fractured relationship with his teammates and interim manager Ralf Rangnick, his performances and his team's declined during the season, with Ronaldo equalling his worst goalscoring run since 2010 during his time with Real Madrid, being two months without scoring a goal,[315] before scoring his first goal in the new year, opening United's 2–0 win home against Brighton & Hove Albion on 15 February 2022.[316] Following a hamstring injury, which saw him miss the Manchester derby against Manchester City, Ronaldo made his return from injury on 12 March, scoring a hat-trick in a 3–2 victory against Tottenham Hotspur, which saw him pass Josef Bican's record for goals scored in professional football with 807 career goals,[317] although the Football Association of the Czech Republic claimed that Bican had scored 821 career goals.[318] On 16 April, Ronaldo scored his 50th club hat-trick in a 3–2 win over Norwich City.[319] On 23 April, he scored his 100th Premier League goal in a 3–1 defeat to Arsenal.[320] After scoring in the following matches against Chelsea and Brentford, he was named the Premier League Player of the Month for April.[321]
He finished the season with 24 goals in all competitions, 18 of those goals being in the Premier League, making him the third-highest goalscorer in the league behind Golden Boot winners Mohamed Salah and Son Heung-min, being named in the Premier League Team of the Year and the winner of United's Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award, given to the club's best player from the previous season;[322][323] however, with United finishing in a disappointing sixth place and qualifying for the UEFA Europa League, Ronaldo went trophyless for the first time since 2010.[324]

2022: Final season and departure
After growing dissatisfaction with the direction of United on and off the field, Ronaldo missed the club's pre-season tour of Thailand and Australia due to family reasons, amid reports of his desire to leave to join a club competing in the Champions League, despite incoming manager Erik ten Hag insisting that he was not for sale and was part of the club's plans.[325] His agent Jorge Mendes began negotiating with various clubs for a transfer on loan or on a free transfer, including Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, with the latter club's new owner Todd Boehly being keen on a possible transfer.[326] However, due to his age, overall cost of a transfer and high wages demands, multiple European clubs rejected the opportunity to sign him, including Chelsea after their manager Thomas Tuchel did not approve his signing.[327]

Ronaldo in a Premier League match against Brighton & Hove Albion in August 2022
Having failed to secure a transfer, Ronaldo lost his place in the starting line-up to Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial, mostly featuring in Europa League matches. He scored his first goal in the competition aged 37, converting a penalty to make it 2–0 against Sheriff Tiraspol on 15 September.[328] On 2 October, Ronaldo was an unused substitute in United's 6–3 loss to Manchester City, with ten Hag saying that he refused to bring him on out of "respect for his big career".[329] On 9 October, Ronaldo came on as a substitute and scored his 700th career club goal in a 2–1 win against Everton.[330] Ten days later, Ronaldo refused to be brought on as a substitute during a home game against Tottenham and left the ground before the full-time whistle;[331][332] Ten Hag punished him by dropping him from the squad for an upcoming fixture with Chelsea, and made him train separately from the first team.[333][334] Following discussions with the manager, Ronaldo returned to training and started in United's home win over Sheriff on 27 October, scoring the third goal and ensuring United's qualification to the Europa League knockout stage.[335] Ten Hag named Ronaldo as captain for a 3–1 defeat to Aston Villa on 6 November, saying that Ronaldo was "an important part of the squad, we are happy with him and now he has to take even more of the leader role".[336] Ronaldo then missed United's following matches before the World Cup break, with Ten Hag saying that Ronaldo was ill.[337]
On 14 November, an interview with Piers Morgan was published, where Ronaldo said that he felt "betrayed" by Ten Hag and senior executives who wanted Ronaldo to leave the club, and accused the club of doubting him regarding the illness of his daughter that led him to miss pre-season, adding that he did not respect ten Hag "because he doesn't show respect for me", leading him to be disappointed with the communication of the club.[338] Ronaldo claimed that ten Hag deliberately provoked him by first leaving him on the bench against City, and then wanting to bring him on in the final moments against Tottenham, but added that he regretted his decision to leave early.[338] He also questioned the appointment of Rangnick the previous season as he was a "sporting director and not even a coach".[338][339] On the club itself, Ronaldo stated there was "no evolution" since the departure of former manager Alex Ferguson in 2013, despite expecting changes in "technology, infrastructure".[338][339] Ronaldo claimed that the Glazer family "did not care about the club" as he never spoke with them, and described United as a "marketing club".[338][339] Following the interview, which aired in two-parts on 16 and 17 November, United began seeking legal action over whether Ronaldo had breached his contract,[340] and were looking to terminate his contract.[341] On 22 November, Ronaldo's contract was terminated by mutual agreement with immediate effect.[342]

Al Nassr
On 30 December 2022, Saudi club Al Nassr reached an agreement for Ronaldo to join the club effective 1 January 2023, signing a contract until 2025.[343] As reported by Fabrizio Romano of The Guardian, Ronaldo received the highest football salary in history, worth €200 million per year;[344][345] this included an annual guaranteed football salary of €90 million, with commercial and sponsorship deals included bringing his total annual salary to €200 million. He was also reportedly paid a signing-on bonus in the region of €100 million.[346] According to media reports, Ronaldo rejected a move to Major League Soccer club Sporting Kansas City to join Al Nassr.[347]

2023: Debut season and league runner-up
Ronaldo was due to appear in a match against Al-Tai on 5 January 2023, but had to serve a two-match ban incurred while he was still at Manchester United for knocking a phone out of a 14-year-old Everton fan's hand after a 1–0 loss at Goodison Park in April 2022.[348] On 19 January, Ronaldo played for the first time since transferring to Saudi Arabia, in an exhibition game featuring a combined team of Riyadh's Al Nassr and Al Hilal players against Paris Saint-Germain.

2023–present: Arab Club Champions Cup winner
Ronaldo's signing for Al-Nassr resulted in increased popularity both domestically and internationally of the Saudi Pro League, with various European players such as Karim Benzema, Sadio Mané, N'Golo Kanté, Rúben Neves, Riyad Mahrez, Roberto Firmino and Neymar moving to the Saudi Pro League during the summer transfer window, crediting Ronaldo as one of the main factors for moving to the league.[356]

Ronaldo (bottom left) playing for Portugal during their semi-final match against the Netherlands at Euro 2004
Ronaldo began his international career with Portugal under-15 in 2001. During his international youth career, Ronaldo would represent the under-15, under-17, under-20, under-21 and under-23 national sides, amassing 34 youth caps and scoring 18 goals overall.[7]
Aged 18, Ronaldo made his first senior appearance for Portugal in a 1–0 win over Kazakhstan on 20 August 2003,[377] coming on as a half-time substitute for Luís Figo.[378] He was subsequently called up for UEFA Euro 2004, held in his home country, and scored his first international goal in a 2–1 group stage loss to eventual champions Greece, his eighth appearance for Portugal.[378] After converting his penalty in a shoot-out against England in the quarter-finals,[379] he helped Portugal reach the final by scoring the opening goal in a 2–1 win over the Netherlands.[380] He was featured in the team of the tournament, having provided two assists in addition to his two goals.[381]
Ronaldo was Portugal's second-highest scorer in their qualification group for the 2006 FIFA World Cup with seven goals.[377] During the tournament, he scored his first World Cup goal against Iran with a penalty kick in Portugal's second match of the group stage.[382] At the age of 21 years and 132 days, Ronaldo became the youngest ever goalscorer for Portugal at a World Cup finals.[383] In Portugal's infamously dirty round of 16 match against the Netherlands, Ronaldo was forced off injured in the first half after a tackle from Dutch defender Khalid Boulahrouz.[378] Following Portugal's 1–0 win, Ronaldo accused Boulahrouz of intentionally trying to injure him, although he recovered in time to play in the next game.[384] In Portugal's quarter-final against England, Ronaldo's Manchester United teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off for stamping on Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho. Although the referee later clarified that the red card was only due to Rooney's infraction,[385] the English media speculated that Ronaldo had influenced his decision by aggressively complaining, after which he was seen in replays winking at Portugal's bench following Rooney's dismissal.[378][386] Ronaldo went on to score the vital winning penalty during the shoot-out which sent Portugal into the semi-finals.[378] Ronaldo was subsequently booed during their 1–0 semi-final defeat to France.[387] FIFA's Technical Study Group overlooked him for the tournament's Best Young Player award and handed it to Germany's Lukas Podolski, citing his behaviour as a factor in the decision.[378][388] Following the 2006 World Cup, Ronaldo would go on to represent Portugal in four qualifying games for Euro 2008, scoring two goals in the process.[389][390]

One day after turning 22, Ronaldo captained Portugal for the first time in a friendly game against Brazil on 6 February 2007,[391] as requested by Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) president Carlos Silva, who had died two days earlier.[391] Ahead of Euro 2008, he was given the number 7 shirt for the first time.[392] While he scored eight goals in qualifications,[393] the second-highest tally, he scored just one goal in the tournament, netting the second goal of their 3–1 win in the group stage match against the Czech Republic. In the same game, he also set-up Portugal's third goal in injury time, which was scored by Quaresma, and was named man of the match for his performance.[394][395] Portugal were eliminated in the quarter-finals with a 3–2 loss against eventual finalists Germany.[396]
After Portugal's unsuccessful performance at Euro 2008, Luiz Felipe Scolari was replaced as coach by Carlos Queiroz, formerly the assistant manager at United.[397] Queiroz made Ronaldo the squad's permanent captain in July 2008.[398] Ronaldo failed to score a single goal in the qualification for the 2010 World Cup,[378] as Portugal narrowly avoided a premature elimination from the tournament with a play-off victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina.[399] In the group stage of the World Cup, he was named man of the match in all three matches, against Ivory Coast, North Korea and Brazil.[400][401][402] His only goal of the tournament came in their 7–0 rout of North Korea, which marked his first international goal in 16 months.[403] Portugal's World Cup ended with a 1–0 loss against eventual champions Spain in the round of 16.[404]
Ronaldo scored seven goals in qualifications for Euro 2012, including two strikes against Bosnia and Herzegovina in the play-offs, to send Portugal into the tournament, where they were drawn in a "group of death".[405] In the last group stage game against the Netherlands, Ronaldo scored twice to secure a 2–1 win.[406] He scored a header in the quarter-final against the Czech Republic to give his team a 1–0 win.[407] In both games against the Netherlands and the Czech Republic he was named man of the match.[408][409] After the semi-finals against Spain ended scoreless, Portugal were eliminated in the penalty shoot-out.[410] Ronaldo did not take a penalty as he had been slated to take the unused fifth slot.[411] Ronaldo's own teammate, Nani, said that Ronaldo "demanded" to take the last penalty.[412] As the joint top scorer with three goals, alongside five other players, he was again included in the team of the tournament.[8]

A qualifying match on 17 October 2012, a 1–1 draw against Northern Ireland, earned him his 100th cap.[413] His first international hat-trick also came against Northern Ireland, when he scored three times in a 15-minute spell of a 4–2 qualifying win on 6 September 2013.[414] After Portugal failed to qualify during the regular campaign, Ronaldo scored all four of the team's goals in the play-offs against Sweden, billed as a battle between Ronaldo and Zlatan Ibrahimović, which ensured their place at the tournament.[415] His hat-trick in the second leg took his international tally to 47 goals, equalling Pauleta's record.[416] Ronaldo subsequently scored twice in a 5–1 friendly win over Cameroon on 5 March 2014 to become his country's all-time top scorer.[417]
Ronaldo took part in the tournament despite suffering from patellar tendinitis and a related thigh injury,[418] potentially risking his career.[419] Ronaldo later commented: "If we had two or three Cristiano Ronaldos in the team I would feel more comfortable. But we don't."[420] Despite ongoing doubts over his fitness, being forced to abort practice twice,[421] Ronaldo played the full 90 minutes of the opening match against Germany, although he was unable to prevent a 4–0 defeat.[422] After assisting an injury-time 2–2 equaliser against the United States,[423] he scored a late match-winning goal in a 2–1 win over Ghana.[424] His 50th international goal made him the first Portuguese to play and score in three World Cups.[425] Portugal were eliminated from the tournament at the close of the group stage on goal difference.[424]

Ronaldo leaps in the air in Portugal's Euro 2016 quarter-final match against Poland.
Ronaldo scored five goals, including a hat-trick against Armenia, in the qualification for Euro 2016.[426] With the only goal in another win over Armenia on 14 November 2014, he reached 23 goals in the UEFA European Championship, including qualifying matches, to become the competition's all-time leading goalscorer.[427] At the start of the tournament, Ronaldo failed to convert his chances in Portugal's draws against Iceland and Austria, despite taking 20 shots on goal. In the latter match, he overtook Figo as Portugal's most capped player with his 128th international appearance, which ended scoreless after he missed a penalty in the second half.[428] With two goals in the last match of the group stage, a 3–3 draw against Hungary, Ronaldo became the first player to score in four European Championships, having made a record 17 appearances in the tournament.[429][430] Although placed third in their group behind Hungary and Iceland, his team qualified for the knockout round as a result of the competition's newly expanded format,[431] despite not winning any of their games.[378]
In Portugal's first knockout match, Ronaldo's only attempt on goal was parried by Croatia's goalkeeper Danijel Subašić into the path of Ricardo Quaresma, whose finish then secured a 1–0 win late in extra time.[378] After his team progressed past Poland on penalties, with Ronaldo scoring Portugal's opening penalty,[378] he became the first player to participate in three European Championship semi-finals;[432] he scored the opener in a 2–0 win against Wales, equalling Michel Platini as the competition's all-time top scorer with nine goals.[433] In the final against hosts France, Ronaldo was forced off after just 25 minutes following a challenge from Dimitri Payet, despite multiple treatments and attempts to play on,[378] he was stretchered off the pitch and replaced by Quaresma. During extra time, substitute Eder scored in the 109th minute to earn Portugal a 1–0 victory.[434] As team captain, Ronaldo lifted the trophy in celebration of his country's first triumph in a major tournament. He was awarded the Silver Boot as the joint second-highest goalscorer, with three goals and three assists, and was named to the team of the tournament for the third time in his career.[435][436]

Ronaldo's hat-trick took his World Cup qualifying goals total to 29, making him the highest scorer in UEFA qualifiers, ahead of Andriy Shevchenko, and the highest goalscorer in World Cup qualifying and finals matches combined with 32 goals, ahead of Miroslav Klose.[446] Ronaldo later added to this tally by scoring a goal against Andorra in a 2–0 win.[447]

On 15 June 2021, Ronaldo scored twice in Portugal's first game of Euro 2020, a 3–0 win against Hungary in Budapest.[465] This took him to a total of 11 European Championship goals, two clear of Michel Platini, as the all-time top goalscorer in the competition's history.[466] He also became the first player to score at five Euros,[467] and in eleven consecutive tournaments. The brace made Ronaldo the oldest player to score two goals in a match in the competition,[468] and the oldest player to score for Portugal at a major tournament.[469] On 23 June, he scored two penalties in Portugal's 2–2 draw with France in their final group stage match, equalling Daei's record of 109 international goals.[470] On 27 June, Portugal were eliminated following a 1–0 loss against Belgium in the round of 16.[471] Ronaldo finished the tournament with five goals (tied with Czech Patrik Schick) and one assist, earning him the Golden Boot.[472]
On 1 September, Ronaldo scored two headed goals, with his second coming seconds before the full-time whistle, in a 2–1 home win against the Republic of Ireland in a World Cup qualifier at the Estádio Algarve, which saw him pass Ali Daei to become the sole record holder by breaking the men's international scoring record with his 110th and 111th international goals.[473] On 9 October, he scored the opening goal in a 3–0 friendly win over Qatar at the Estádio Algarve; with his 181st international appearance, he also overtook Sergio Ramos's record for the most international caps received by a European player.[474][475] In the following match against Luxembourg on 12 October, also played at the Estádio Algarve, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 5–0 win for Portugal, and became the first player to score 10 hat-tricks in men's international football.[476]

Ronaldo was named in Portugal's squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, making it his fifth World Cup. On 24 November, in Portugal's opening match against Ghana, Ronaldo scored a penalty kick and became the first male player to score in five different World Cups.[477] In the last group game against South Korea, Ronaldo received criticism from his own coach for his reaction at being substituted.[478] He was dropped from the starting line-up for Portugal's last 16 match against Switzerland, marking the first time since Euro 2008 that he had not started a game for Portugal in a major international tournament,[479] and the first time Portugal had started a knockout game without Ronaldo in the starting line-up at an international tournament since Euro 2000.[480] He came off the bench late on as Portugal won 6–1, their highest tally in a World Cup knockout game since the 1966 World Cup, with Ronaldo's replacement Gonçalo Ramos scoring a hat-trick.[481] Portugal employed the same strategy in the quarter-finals against Morocco, with Ronaldo once again coming off the bench; in the process, he equalled Bader Al-Mutawa's international appearance record, becoming the joint–most capped male footballer of all time, with 196 caps. Portugal lost 1–0, with Morocco becoming the first CAF nation ever to reach the World Cup semi-finals.[482][483]
Following the World Cup, despite having his future with the national team in doubt, after rumours of a possible omission by new manager Roberto Martínez, Ronaldo was named in Portugal's squad for the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifiers against Liechtenstein and Luxembourg.[484] On 23 March, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 4–0 win over Liechtenstein; with his 197th international appearance, he overtook Al-Mutawa's record and became the most capped male footballer of all time.[485] On 20 June, Ronaldo made his 200th appearance for his national team, scoring the only goal of an away win over Iceland, in the Euro qualifiers, as he became the first player in the history of men's international football to make 200 appearances for his country.[486] On 13 October, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 3–2 win over Slovakia, leading Portugal to qualify for Euro 2024, marking the nation's fastest qualification to a major tournament in their history.[487] On 16 October, Portugal secured first place in their group, following a 5–0 away victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina, with Ronaldo scoring twice.[488] The landmark goals saw him score in more than 100 goals in each of the last three decades (2000s, 2010s, 2020s).[489][490]

Player profile
Style of play
A versatile attacker, Ronaldo is capable of playing on either wing as well as through the centre of the pitch,[491] and, while ostensibly right-footed, is very strong with both feet.[492] Tactically, Ronaldo has undergone several evolutions throughout his career. While at Sporting and during his first season at Manchester United, he was typically deployed as a traditional winger on the right side of midfield, where he regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area. In this position, he was able to use his pace and acceleration, agility and technical skills to take on opponents in one-on-one situations. Ronaldo became noted for his dribbling and flair, often displaying an array of tricks and feints,[493][494] such as the step overs and so-called 'chops' that became his trademark;[495] he has also been known to use the flip-flap.[496]

Ronaldo controlling the ball on his chest during a 2010–11 La Liga game against Almería. At his peak, he was known for his exceptional speed and athleticism.[497]
His strength and jumping ability, combined with his elevation, heading accuracy and height of 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1⁄2 in), give him an edge in winning aerial duels. These attributes allow him to function as a target-man and make him an aerial goal threat in the penalty area; consequently, many of his goals have been headers.[498][499][500] Allied with his increased stamina and work-rate, his goalscoring ability improved drastically on the left wing where he was given the positional freedom to move into the centre to finish attacks. He has also increasingly played a creative role for his team, often dropping deep to pick up the ball, participate in the build-up of plays and create chances for his teammates, courtesy of his vision and passing ability.[493][498]
In his final seasons at United, Ronaldo played an even more attacking and central role, functioning both as a striker and as a supporting forward, or even as an attacking midfielder on occasion.[498] He developed into a prolific goalscorer, capable of finishing well both inside the penalty area and from distance with an accurate and powerful shot, courtesy of his striking ability.[498] An accurate penalty kick taker,[501] he also became a set piece specialist, renowned for his powerful, bending free kicks.[502] When taking free kicks, Ronaldo is known for using the knuckleball technique, which was developed by Juninho Pernambucano.[503] He also adopts a trademark stance before striking the ball, which involves him standing with his legs far apart.[504] Regarding Ronaldo's unique style of taking free kicks, former United assistant manager Mike Phelan commented: "People used to put the ball down, walk away, run up and hit it. He brought in a more dynamic showmanship. He places the ball down, the concentration level is high, he takes his certain amount of steps back so that his standing foot is in the perfect place to hit the ball in the sweet spot. He is the ultimate showman. He has that slight arrogance. When he pulls those shorts up and shows his thighs, he is saying 'All eyes on me' and this is going in. He understands the marketing side of it. The way he struts up and places it; the world is watching him."[505]

As Ronaldo entered his thirties he began to dribble less.[506]
At Real Madrid, Ronaldo continued to play a more offensive role, while his creative and defensive duties became more limited, although not entirely diminished.[507] Initially deployed as a centre forward by managers Manuel Pellegrini and José Mourinho, he was later moved back onto the left wing, though in a free tactical role; this position allowed him to drift into the centre at will to get onto the end of crosses and score, or draw out defenders with his movement off the ball and leave space for teammates to exploit.[507][508][509] Madrid's counter-attacking style of play also allowed him to become a more efficient and consistent player, as evidenced by his record-breaking goalscoring feats. While he mainly drew praise in the media for his prolific goalscoring, Ronaldo also demonstrated his ability as an effective creator in this role.[510][511][512] This unique role has been described by pundits as that of a "false", "attacking", or "goalscoring winger", as Ronaldo effectively almost functioned as a striker at times with his central runs into the penalty area, despite actually playing on the left flank.[508][513] From 2013 onwards, under manager Carlo Ancelotti, he effectively adapted his style to the physical effects of ageing with increasingly reduced off-the-ball movement and general involvement, completing fewer dribbles and passes per game, and instead focusing on short-distance creating and goalscoring.[507][514][515] Since 2017, Ronaldo adapted his style of play yet again to become more of a free-roaming centre forward under manager Zinedine Zidane, a role in which he continued to excel and maintain a prolific goalscoring record; in this position, he earned praise in the media for his intelligent movement both on and off the ball, positional sense, link-up play and finishing, as well as his ability to lose or anticipate his markers, find space in the box and score from few touches or opportunities.[516][517][518]
In his first season at Juventus, Ronaldo continued to play in a variety of different attacking roles under manager Massimiliano Allegri, depending on whom he was partnered with. While he had occupied an increasingly offensive role in his final years at Real Madrid, at times he functioned in a free role at Juventus, either as a lone striker or in his trademark role on the left wing, in a 4–2–3–1 or 4–3–3 formation, in which he often switched positions with Mario Mandžukić. In this role, he was also given licence to drop deep or even out wide onto the right flank to receive the ball, and be more involved in the build-up of plays; as such, aside from scoring goals himself, he began to take on opponents and create chances for other players with greater frequency than he had in his final seasons with Real Madrid. Off the ball, he was also capable of creating space for teammates with his movement and attacking runs into the box, or finishing off chances with his head or feet by getting onto the end of his teammates' crosses.[519][520] On occasion he also played in an attacking partnership alongside Mandžukić in a 4–3–1–2, 4–4–2, or 3–5–2 formation.[521][522][523] He continued to play a similar role in his second season with the club under manager Maurizio Sarri.[520]

"In the six years we had him, you just saw his game grow all the time, and he was a fantastic player. Now you see the complete player. His decision-making, his maturity, his experience, plus all the great skills he has got, they all make him the complete player."

Ronaldo is widely regarded as one of the two best players of his generation, alongside Lionel Messi.[525] Winning his first Ballon d'Or in 2008 by a record-high vote count at age 23, over the next decade Ronaldo has often featured in debates concerning who is the greatest player in history.[526] Acclaimed for his prolific and consistent goal-scoring,[527] he is considered a decisive player who is also a game changer,[528] especially in important and high-pressured situations.[529]

Ronaldo is noted for his work ethic, elite body conditioning and dedication to improvement on the training pitch, as well being regarded as a natural leader.[530][531] On his longevity and "extraordinary commitment to physical preparation", Adam Bate of Sky Sports said: "Dedication is a huge part of staying at the top and Ronaldo's focus is perhaps unparalleled within the game."[506] While stating they were stylistically different players who shared an equal desire to score goals, former Brazil international Ronaldo praised Cristiano's approach to training, arguing that "there are so few players who take care of their body like he does. I trained because I had to, he does it because he loves it."[532] His drive and determination to succeed are fuelled by a desire to be talked about alongside other greats such as Pelé and Diego Maradona once retiring.[533] He is credited, along with his compatriot, coach José Mourinho, with inspiring changing fortunes of Portuguese football in 2010s and 2020s.[534] At times, he has been criticised for simulating when tackled.[535] He was also occasionally criticised early in his career by manager Alex Ferguson, teammates and the media for being a selfish or overly flamboyant player.[536] Jonathan Wilson of The Guardian opined that Ronaldo had made Juventus, who he joined aged 33 in 2018, weaker, due to "his relative immobility" in his mid-30s, even if his personal goal-scoring output remained high.[537]
During his career, Ronaldo has also been described as having an "arrogant image" on the pitch,[538] with Ronaldo stating that he had become a "victim" because of how he was portrayed in the media.[539] He is often seen moaning, gesticulating and scowling while trying to inspire his team to victory,[538] with Ronaldo insisting that his competitive nature should not be mistaken for arrogance.[539] His managers, teammates and various journalists have said that this reputation has caused an unfair image of him.[540][541][542]

Goal celebrations
Ronaldo has adopted several goal celebrations throughout his career, including one particular celebration which gained widespread coverage in the media, when he squatted and stared directly into a camera on the sidelines of the pitch with his hand on his chin.[543][544][545] After scoring a goal, he usually celebrates with a "storming jump" and "turn", before "landing in spread-eagled fashion"[544] into his "signature power stance",[545] while usually simultaneously exclaiming "Sí" (Spanish and Italian for "yes").[543][546] This trademark celebration has been dubbed the "Siu" in the media.[543][544][547]

Rivalry with Lionel Messi
Main article: Messi–Ronaldo rivalry
Ronaldo with Lionel Messi before an international friendly between Portugal and Argentina in 2011
Both Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have scored in multiple UEFA Champions League finals and have regularly broken the 50-goal barrier in a single season. Sports journalists and pundits regularly weigh the individual merits of both players in an attempt to argue who they believe is the best player in modern football or in the history of the game.[548] It has been compared to several sports rivalries, among them the Muhammad Ali–Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Borg–McEnroe rivalry in tennis and the Senna–Prost rivalry from Formula One motor racing.[549][550] Some commentators choose to analyse the differing physiques and playing styles of the two.[551] Part of the debate revolves around the contrasting personalities of the two players, as Ronaldo is sometimes depicted as an arrogant and theatrical showoff, while Messi is portrayed as a shy, humble character.[552][553][554]



"It's part of my life now. People are bound to compare us. He tries to do his best for his club and for his national team, as I do, and there is a degree of rivalry with both of us trying to do the best for the teams we represent."


—Ronaldo commenting on his rivalry with Messi.[555]

In a 2012 interview, Ronaldo commented on the rivalry, saying: "I think we push each other sometimes in the competition, this is why the competition is so high."[556] Alex Ferguson, Ronaldo's manager during his time at Manchester United, opined: "I don't think the rivalry against each other bothers them. I think they have their own personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best."[557] Messi himself denied any rivalry, saying that it was "only the media, the press, who wants us to be at loggerheads but I've never fought with Cristiano."[558] Responding to the claims that he and Messi do not get on well on a personal level, Ronaldo commented: "We don't have a relationship outside the world of football, just as we don't with a lot of other players." Ronaldo added that in years to come he hopes they can laugh about it together, stating: "We have to look on this rivalry with a positive spirit, because it's a good thing."[555] Representing archrivals Barcelona and Real Madrid, the two players faced each other at least twice every season in the world's biggest club game, El Clásico, which is among the world's most viewed annual sporting events.[559]
In a debate at Oxford Union in October 2013, when asked whether FIFA president Sepp Blatter preferred Messi or Ronaldo, Blatter paid tribute to the work ethic of the Argentine before taking a swipe at Ronaldo, claiming "one of them has more expenses for the hairdresser than the other." Real Madrid demanded and promptly received a full apology. In response to Blatter's "commander" on the pitch comment, Ronaldo issued his own riposte with a mock-salute celebration after scoring a penalty against Sevilla.[560] In August 2019, Ronaldo and Messi were interviewed while sat next to each other prior to the announcement of the UEFA Men's Player of the Year, with Ronaldo stating: "I pushed him and he pushed me as well. So it's good to be part of the history of football."[561]
In September 2023, Ronaldo declared that his rivalry with Messi was over and "gone", after 36 official fixtures and 15 years of "sharing the stage".[562] After Messi led Argentina to victory in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a number of football critics, commentators and players have opined that Messi has settled the debate between the two players.[563][564][565]

Philanthropy
Ronaldo pictured in 2010
Ronaldo has made contributions to various charitable causes throughout his career. Television footage of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami showed an eight-year-old boy survivor named Martunis wearing a Portuguese football shirt who was stranded for 19 days after his family was killed. Following this, Ronaldo visited Aceh, Indonesia, to raise funds for rehabilitation and reconstruction.[624][625] After accepting undisclosed damages from a libel case against The Sun newspaper in 2008, Ronaldo donated the damages to a charity in Madeira.[626] In 2009, Ronaldo donated £100,000 to the hospital that saved his mother's life in Madeira following her battle with cancer, so that they could build a cancer centre on the island.[627] In support of the victims of the 2010 Madeira flood, Ronaldo pledged to play in a charity match in Madeira between Primeira Liga club Porto and players from Madeiran-based clubs Marítimo and Nacional.[628]
In 2012, Ronaldo and his agent paid for specialist treatment for a nine-year-old Canarian boy with apparently terminal cancer.[629] In December 2012, Ronaldo joined FIFA's "11 for Health" programme to raise awareness amongst kids of how to steer clear of conditions including drug addiction, HIV, malaria, and obesity.[630] In January 2013, Ronaldo became Save the Children's new Global Artist Ambassador, in which he hopes to help fight child hunger and obesity.[631] In March 2013, Ronaldo agreed to be the ambassador for The Mangrove Care Forum in Indonesia, an organisation aiming to raise awareness of mangrove conservation.[632]

Personal life
Family, children, and relationships
Ronaldo has five living children. He first became a father to a son, who was born on 17 June 2010 in the United States.[635] He has full custody of the child and has not publicly revealed the identity of the mother per an agreement with her.[636][637] In January 2015, Ronaldo's five-year relationship with Russian model Irina Shayk ended.[638]
Ronaldo became a father to twins,[639] born on 8 June 2017 in the United States via surrogacy. He is currently in a relationship with Argentine-born Spanish model Georgina Rodríguez,[640] who gave birth to a daughter on 12 November 2017.[641] The couple expected a pair of twins in 2022. The male twin died during childbirth while the female twin survived.[642][643]

In January 2023, after Ronaldo moved to Saudi Arabia with his family having been signed by Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr, the rulers of the Muslim-leaning Kingdom made Ronaldo an exception to the rule that unmarried couples are not allowed to live together in Saudi Arabia. An unnamed Saudi lawyer told Spanish news agency EFE that "the laws of the Kingdom still prohibit cohabitation without a marriage contract", but Saudi authorities have begun to "turn a blind eye and stop prosecuting anyone, even though these laws are applied when there is a problem or a crime".[645]
Ronaldo is of Cape Verdean descent through his great-grandmother.[646] He is a Roman Catholic.[647]

Health
Ronaldo has said that he does not drink alcohol,[626] and he received libel damages over a Daily Mirror article that reported him drinking heavily in a nightclub while recovering from an injury in July 2008.[648] He also does not have any tattoos as he regularly donates blood and bone marrow.[649]

Legal issues
In July 2017, Ronaldo was charged with fraudulently evading almost €15 million in tax between 2011 and 2014, a claim he denied at the time.[650] In June 2018, Ronaldo was given a two-year suspended jail sentence and fined €18.8 million, later reduced to €16.8 million after reaching a deal with Spanish authorities. The sentence can be served under probation, without any jail time, so long as he does not re-offend.[651]
Ronaldo and another man were investigated by the British Crown Prosecution Service after a 2005 rape allegation was brought forward by two women. Within days, the two women withdrew their allegation and Scotland Yard later issued a statement declaring there was not enough evidence for a prosecution.[652]
In April 2017, it was reported that Ronaldo was being investigated by the Las Vegas Police Department for an allegation by a woman that he had raped her in 2009.[653][654] Documents, confirmed by Ronaldo's lawyers, state that Ronaldo paid a woman US$375,000 in a non-disclosure settlement.[653][655] Ronaldo and his lawyers issued a lengthy statement denying all accusations, describing them as an "intentional defamation campaign" with parts significantly "altered and/or completely fabricated",[656][657] a claim which Der Spiegel categorically denied.[658] In July 2019, Las Vegas prosecutors said they would not charge Ronaldo over allegations of rape; the statement added: "Based upon a review of information at this time, the allegations of sexual assault against Cristiano Ronaldo cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt."[659] The same woman, in September 2018, filed a civil lawsuit in Nevada accusing Ronaldo of rape.[660] The Daily Mirror, citing court documents, reported in 2021 that the woman sought £56 million in damages from Ronaldo.[661] In October 2021, federal magistrate judge Daniel Albregts recommended that the lawsuit be dismissed, citing that the woman's lawyer, Leslie Stovall, "acted in bad faith by asking for, receiving, and using Football Leaks documents to prosecute" the case, despite the documents containing "privileged communications" between Ronaldo and his lawyers. Additionally, Albregts stated that no evidence was found of Ronaldo's lawyers having "intimidated [the woman] or impeded law enforcement" during the 2010 settlement with her.[662] In June 2022, the woman's rape lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, as district judge Jennifer A. Dorsey ruled that Stovall's repeated use of "cyber-hacked attorney–client privileged documents" were actions representing "abuses and flagrant circumvention of the proper litigation process".[660][663]

Notes

^ Varies between 1.85 and 1.89 by source. FIFA and Sports Illustrated give 1.85,[2][3] Luca Caioli [es; fi] 1.86,[4] Soccerway and Eurosport 1.87,[5] Premier League 1.87,[6] and the Portuguese Football Federation 1.89.[7]

^ Although there was no third-place playoff, both losing semi-finalists (Germany and Portugal) were awarded bronze medals by UEFA.[8]

^ The terminology for the award has varied. Ronaldo received three Ballons d'Or as awarded by France Football magazine (2008, 2016, 2017) and two FIFA Ballons d'Or (2013, 2014) as well as the 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year and 2016 and 2017 Best FIFA Men's Player awards.

^ Real Madrid had previously recognised Ronaldo as their all-time top scorer after he scored a brace against Malmö FF on 30 September 2015. The club's official record book attributes to Ronaldo a 74th-minute goal in a 2–1 win over Real Sociedad on 18 September 2010, despite his free-kick having been deflected by Pepe.[209]

Kylian Mbappé Lottin (born 20 December 1998) is a French professional footballer who plays as a forward for  Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and captains the France national team. Regarded as one of the best players in the world, he is known for his dribbling, speed, and finishing.[2][3][4]
Born in Paris and raised in nearby Bondy, Mbappé began his senior club career in 2015 with Monaco, where he won the Ligue 1 title in the 2016–17 season. In 2017, aged 18, Mbappé signed for Paris Saint-Germain on an eventual permanent transfer worth €180 million, making him the second-most-expensive player and most expensive teenage player of all time.[5] With PSG, he has won five Ligue 1 titles and three Coupes de France, including a domestic quadruple in the 2019–20 season, while also leading the club to its first ever UEFA Champions League final in 2020. He is the club's all-time top goalscorer and ranks third all time in assists. He is the eighth-highest goalscorer in Ligue 1 history.
At international level, Mbappé made his senior debut for France in 2017, at age of 18. At the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Mbappé became the youngest French player to score at a World Cup, as well as the second teenager, after Pelé, to score in a World Cup final. He finished as the joint second-highest goalscorer as France won the tournament; he went on to win the FIFA World Cup Best Young Player and French Player of the Year awards for his performances. He also helped France to victory in the UEFA Nations League in 2021, receiving the top scorer award in the finals. At the 2022 FIFA World Cup, France reached the final again; Mbappé won the Golden Boot and Silver Ball and set the record for the most goals scored in World Cup final matches by scoring a hat-trick.
Mbappé finished in third place for the 2023 Ballon d'Or and was runner-up for the 2022 The Best FIFA Men's Player award. He was named to the FIFA FIFPro World11 in 2018, 2019 and 2022, the UEFA Team of the Year in 2018 and the UEFA Champions League Squad of the Season in 2016–17, 2019–20, 2020–21 and 2021–22. He was awarded the Golden Boy in 2017, the Kopa Trophy in 2018, and was shortlisted for the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year in 2019 and 2023. Mbappé has been named Ligue 1 Player of the Year a record four times, and has finished as the Ligue 1 top scorer for a joint-record five seasons; in the 2021–22 season, he became the first player to finish as both Ligue 1 top scorer and top assist provider. In 2023, he was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world, and was ranked third on the Forbes list of the world's highest-paid athletes.


Early life
Kylian Mbappé Lottin[6] was born on 20 December 1998[7] in the 19th arrondissement of Paris[8] and was raised in Bondy, Seine-Saint-Denis, in the northeastern suburbs of Paris.[9] His father, Wilfrid [fr], is originally from the Cameroonian island of Djébalè [fr],[10] and, as well as being his agent, is a football coach. His mother, Fayza Lamari, is of Algerian Kabyle origin and is a former handball player.[11][12][13][14] He has a younger brother, Ethan, who plays in the Paris Saint-Germain Academy.[15][16] Their older adoptive brother, Jirès Kembo Ekoko, is a former professional footballer.[17]
As a child, Mbappé went to a private Catholic school in Bondy, where he was considered academically gifted but unruly.[18] At 15, he began taking Spanish lessons, and eventually became fluent in the language.[19] Among Mbappé's idols growing up were Zinedine Zidane,[20] Cristiano Ronaldo,[21] Neymar,[22] Ronaldinho,[23] Lionel Messi,[22] Ronaldo Nazario,[24] Eden Hazard[25] and Thierry Henry.[26][27] As a child, Mbappé received Robinho's AC Milan shirt as a gift from his nanny's family, who were supporters of the Italian club.[28][29] However, Mbappé aspired to play for Real Madrid.[30]

Club career
Early career
Mbappé was coached by his father, Wilfrid, when he started his career with AS Bondy. Another of his youth coaches at AS Bondy, Antonio Riccardi, stated,

The first time I coached him was when he was six years old. You could tell he was different. Kylian could do much more than the other children. His dribbling was already fantastic and he was much faster than the others. He was the best player I've ever seen in 15 years coaching here. In Paris, there are many talents but I'd never seen a talent like him. He was what we call a 'crack' (the best).[31]
Eventually, Mbappé moved to the Clairefontaine academy, putting in a host of impressive performances leading to numerous French clubs, and Real Madrid, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City and Bayern Munich, attempting to sign him.[14] At the age of 11, Real Madrid invited him to train with their under-12s and visit the club's facilities.[32] At age 14, he travelled to London after an invite from Chelsea, playing a match for their youth team against Charlton Athletic.[33]

Monaco
In July 2013, at the age of 14, Mbappé joined the youth academy of Monaco, signing a three-year contract.[34][35] The club had beat competition from Real Madrid and Zinedine Zidane, who was "very involved" in efforts to sign him.[36]

2015–16: Development
In October 2015, Mbappé was brought in by Leonardo Jardim to be a mainstay in Monaco's reserve team, but his level of skill and maturity prompted his promotion to the main squad after just three weeks.[37] He made his first team debut two months later, on 2 December 2015, in a 1–1 Ligue 1 home draw against Caen, replacing Fábio Coentrão after 88 minutes. Mbappé therefore became Monaco's youngest-ever first-team player, aged 16 years and 347 days, breaking the previous record set by Thierry Henry in 1994.[34][38]
On 20 February 2016, Mbappé scored his first goal for the club's first team, a stoppage-time goal in a 3–1 league win over Troyes at the Stade Louis II; at the age of 17 years and 62 days, he became the youngest first-team goalscorer in Monaco's history—once again displacing Henry in the process.[39][40] On 6 March 2016, Mbappé signed his first professional contract, a three-year deal, tying him to Monaco until June 2019.[41] In an interview with CNN, Vadim Vasilyev, AS Monaco's vice-president, stated that he knew early on that Mbappé was a "phenomenon".[42]

2016–17: Breakthrough and league title

Mbappé scored the first hat-trick of his first-team career on 14 December 2016, in a 7–0 home win over Rennes in the Coupe de la Ligue round of 16 – the first hat-trick scored by any Monaco player in the competition since Sonny Anderson in 1997.[43][44][38] On 11 February 2017, Mbappé scored the first Ligue 1 hat-trick of his career in a 5–0 home win over Metz; at 18 years and two months, he became the youngest player to score a league hat-trick since Jérémy Ménez did so for Sochaux back in 2005.[45] On 21 February, Mbappé scored Monaco's second goal in the 40th minute of a 5–3 loss away to Manchester City in the UEFA Champions League round of 16. It was his first European-competition goal, and he became the second-youngest French scorer in Champions League history, behind only Karim Benzema.[46][47] On 5 March, Mbappé scored two first-half goals in a 4–0 home win over Nantes to bring his Ligue 1 career tally to ten goals, becoming the youngest player in the previous thirty years to reach the ten-goal mark in the league.[48][49] On 11 March, he scored a goal in a 2–1 home win over Bordeaux, registering his seventh goal in his previous four league starts.[50]
On 15 March 2017, Mbappé scored Monaco's opening goal in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16 tie with Manchester City. Monaco went on to win 3–1, and with the aggregate score being tied 6–6, advanced to the quarter-finals thanks to the away goals rule.[51] In the quarter-finals against Borussia Dortmund, Mbappé won a penalty and scored two goals as Monaco won the first leg 3–2 at the Westfalenstadion.[52] In the second leg at home, he opened the scoring as Monaco won 3–1 and advanced to the semi-finals.[53] They were eventually eliminated from the Champions League following a 4–1 loss on aggregate to Juventus, with Mbappé scoring his team's lone goal in the second leg.[54] Mbappé ended the 2016–17 season with 26 goals from 44 matches in all competitions, as Monaco won the Ligue 1 title.[55] He credited fellow Monaco striker Radamel Falcao as a key influence on him throughout the season, giving him the space to express himself and teaching him to be "calm" and "serene" during the game.[56]

Paris Saint-Germain
2017–18: World record transfer and domestic treble
On 31 August 2017, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) announced the signing of Mbappé from Monaco on loan with a mandatory purchase option of €180 million.[57][58] According to PSG's assistant sporting director Luis Ferrer, the shift in Mbappé's decision to join the club was partly thanks to a "convincing" speech given by manager Unai Emery at the Mbappés' home over the summer.[59][60][61] The €180 million fee made Mbappé the most expensive teenager ever and the second-most-expensive player ever (behind teammate Neymar), and broke the record for the largest transfer within a domestic league.[62][63][64][65] He was handed the number 29 shirt upon arrival in the French capital.[66]
On 8 September 2017, Mbappé made his PSG debut in a 5–1 Ligue 1 win away at Metz, scoring a goal.[67] Four days later, he recorded his first European goal for the club in a 5–0 UEFA Champions League group stage away defeat of Celtic.[68] He starred in PSG's 3–0 victory over Bayern Munich in the second group game of the Champions League, setting up goals for Edinson Cavani and Neymar, the latter seeing him taking out a defender with a feint by rolling the ball under his foot.[69] On 6 December, Mbappé scored his tenth career Champions League goal in a 3–1 defeat to Bayern Munich, becoming the youngest player to reach that mark, at the age of 18 years and 11 months.[70] Having already won his first league title with the club, on 8 May 2018, Mbappé featured in PSG's 2–0 win over Les Herbiers in the Coupe de France final.[71]

2018–19: Ligue 1 Player of the Year
Mbappé with Paris Saint-Germain in 2019
In July 2018, Mbappé was given the number 7 jersey for the upcoming season with PSG, taking up the squad number left vacant by Lucas Moura.[72] Sporting the hashtag #K7LIAN, Mbappé stated, "I keep trying to progress on the pitch and I think that, for me, it was the right time to change number. It is something of an affirmation. The No. 7 shirt is a legendary one and many greats have worn it. I hope that I will be able to do this number justice on the pitch."[72]
In his first appearance of the season, Mbappé scored twice in the last 10 minutes as PSG won 3–1 against Guingamp in Ligue 1.[73] In the following league game, the front three of Mbappé, Cavani and Neymar all scored in a 3–1 win over Angers at home, with Mbappé – starting his first game of the season – scoring from a volley and setting up Neymar to score the third.[74] On 1 September, he scored and assisted in a 4–2 away win over Nîmes, but was sent off for the first time in his career with a straight red card in injury time, after shoving Téji Savanier in retaliation for a late challenge from behind, for which Savanier was also sent off.[75] Regarding his sending-off, Mbappé told reporters after the match, "If I had the chance to do it over again, I would do the same thing. I will apologise to the supporters and everybody, but I cannot tolerate this sort of thing."[76] On 8 October, Mbappé scored four goals in just 13 minutes in a 5–0 home victory over Lyon and became the youngest player (at 19 years and 9 months) to score four goals in one game in Ligue 1 over the last forty-five seasons.[77] On 3 December, Mbappé was the inaugural winner of the Kopa Trophy, which is awarded by France Football to the best under-21 player in the world.[78]
On 19 January 2019, Mbappé was one of two players (the other being Cavani) to score a hat-trick in a 9–0 win over Guingamp, breaking a record PSG had set the previous season.[79] On 12 February, he scored a goal in a 2–0 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford in the Champions League round of 16.[80] On 2 March, he scored twice in a 2–1 away win over Caen to reach his 50th goal with the club.[81] On 6 March, PSG lost 3–1 at home against Manchester United and was subsequently knocked out from the Champions League on the away goals rule.[82] On 21 April, he scored a hat-trick in a 3–1 win against Monaco, netting his first goals against his former club.[83] PSG finished the season as Ligue 1 champions,[84] with Mbappé winning the Player of the Year award,[85] while also finishing the season as the top goalscorer with 33 goals.[84]

2019–20: Domestic quadruple and European final

On 3 August, Mbappé scored in a 2–1 win over Rennes to capture his first title of the 2019–20 season, the Trophée des Champions.[86] He then scored again in PSG's opening Ligue 1 match of the season, a 3–0 home win over Nîmes on 11 August.[87] On 22 October, he came off the bench and scored a perfect hat-trick in a 5–0 away win over Belgian side Club Brugge in the Champions League;[88] at the age of 20 years and 306 days, he became the youngest player ever to score at least 15 goals in the competition.[89]
On 1 May 2020, PSG were crowned Ligue 1 champions after the season had been called off amid the COVID-19 pandemic; at the time of the league's premature suspension, PSG were in first place, with a twelve–point lead over second–placed Marseille.[90][91] Mbappé finished the 2019–20 season as joint-top scorer in Ligue 1 with 18 goals, along with Monaco's Wissam Ben Yedder; however, Mbappé was assigned the title due to his higher goals-per-game ratio.[92] On 24 July, in the Coupe de France final against Saint-Étienne, Mbappé was forced off after sustaining an injury following a challenge from Loïc Perrin, who was sent off; PSG won the match 1–0,[93] although Mbappé was ruled out of the Coupe de la Ligue final,[94] which PSG went on to win, completing a domestic treble.[95] He returned to action in the Champions League quarter-final against Atalanta on 12 August, coming on a substitute, and assisting Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting's match–winning goal in injury time.[96] PSG eventually suffered a 1–0 loss to Bayern Munich in the Champions League final on 23 August.[97]

2020–21: Third time top scorer and cup triumph
Mbappé missed the first three matches of the season after contracting COVID-19 while being on international duty.[98] He returned to action on 20 September 2020, in a 3–0 away win against Nice, and scored a goal from a penalty kick.[99] On 28 October, Mbappé recorded two assists, both for Moise Kean, in a 2–0 Champions League group stage victory against İstanbul Başakşehir.[100] In doing so, he became the player with the most assists in the competition since the beginning of the 2017–18 edition, with his tally adding up to fourteen over the four seasons.[101] In a Ligue 1 match against Montpellier on 5 December, Mbappé scored his 100th goal for PSG, becoming only the fifth player to achieve the feat for the Parisian club.[102] In his side's final Champions League group match, Mbappé scored his first two goals of the European campaign against Başakşehir, as PSG won 5–1 and qualified for the knockout phase as group winners.[103] He also became the youngest player in Champions League history to reach twenty goals (although this record would then be surpassed by Erling Haaland later on in the same season).[104][105]
On 16 February 2021, Mbappé became only the third player, after Faustino Asprilla and Andriy Shevchenko, to score a Champions League hat-trick against Barcelona, doing so in PSG's 4–1 round of 16 win at the Camp Nou.[106] Mbappé's hat-trick also saw him overtake Pauleta's total of 109 goals to become PSG's third-highest scorer, with only Cavani (200 goals) and Zlatan Ibrahimović (156 goals) getting more for the club.[107] On 27 February, Mbappé scored twice in a 4–0 away win against Dijon, becoming the first player to score five braces in the Ligue 1 season.[108] In the second leg against Barcelona on 10 March, Mbappé scored from the spot in a 1–1 draw at the Parc de Princes, as his side advanced to the quarter-finals 5–2 on aggregate.[109] Mbappé's penalty was his 25th Champions League goal, surpassing opponent Lionel Messi as the youngest player to reach this milestone, at 22 years and 80 days. Adding to his hat-trick from the first leg, Mbappé additionally became the first player to score four goals against Barcelona in a single Champions League season.[110]
In the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final against Bayern Munich on 7 April, Mbappé scored two goals, helping his team to a 3–2 win at the Allianz Arena, PSG's first victory in Munich since 1994.[111] The French club later progressed to the semi-finals to be eventually eliminated by Manchester City: the forward missed the second leg due to a calf injury.[112] On 19 May, Mbappé scored once and assisted the second in the Coupe de France final against his former club Monaco, as PSG won 2–0 to claim their first major trophy of the season.[113] He ended the Ligue 1 campaign with 27 goals, becoming the top scorer for the third consecutive season, although PSG missed out on the Ligue 1 title – it was the first time in Mbappé's career where he did not win the league after four consecutive successes.[114][115] Mbappé ended the season by receiving the Ligue 1 Player of the Year award and being included in the Ligue 1 Team of the Season.[116]

2021–22: Player of the Year and contract extension

On 14 August 2021, prior to Paris Saint-Germain's opening home match of the 2021–22 season against Strasbourg, Mbappé was booed by the Parc des Princes amidst rumours that he wanted to sign for Spanish club Real Madrid.[117] The match ended in a 4–2 victory for the Parisians, with the forward setting up three of his team's goals.[118] He scored his first goal of the season in a 4–2 away win against Brest six days later.[119] In the following match against Reims on 29 August, in which Lionel Messi notably made his debut for PSG, Mbappé scored a brace in a 2–0 Rouge-et-Bleu victory.[120] On 24 November, he scored in a 2–1 Champions League defeat to Manchester City at the City of Manchester Stadium.[121] On 7 December, he scored two goals in a 4–1 Champions League home win over Club Brugge. The goals, which were his 30th and 31st in the Champions League, made him the youngest player to reach this milestone in the history of the competition.[122]
On 12 December 2021, Mbappé scored twice against Monaco in Ligue 1 to reach a century of league goals for PSG. At 22 years and 357 days old, he became the youngest player to score 100 goals for a single team in the French top-flight since Opta began recording data in the 1950–51 season.[123] On 3 January 2022, Mbappé scored his first hat-trick of the season in a 4–0 Coupe de France win over Vannes.[124] On 11 February, he scored the winning goal in stoppage time in a 1–0 league win over Rennes,[125] a feat he repeated four days later, in a 1–0 Champions League victory over Real Madrid in the first leg of the round of 16.[126] He scored another goal in the second leg, making him the second-highest goalscorer in Paris Saint-Germain's history; however, his team was knocked out following a 3–1 defeat at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.[127][128]
On 21 May 2022, Mbappé extended his contract with PSG until 2025,[129] despite speculations of a possible transfer to Real Madrid,[130] which prompted La Liga officials to file a complaint to UEFA regarding accumulating losses of PSG in the previous years.[131] Mbappé himself reportedly called and spoke to Real Madrid's president Florentino Pérez, telling him that he would not be signing for Real Madrid.[132] According to Sky Sports, the financial details of Mbappé's contract included a monthly wage of £4 million, making him the highest-paid player in the world.[133] Mbappé and PSG also reportedly secured a signing-on figure in the region of £100 million.[133] In the hours following the forward's contract extension, he scored a hat-trick in a 5–0 win over Metz, to finish the season with 28 goals as top scorer for the fourth consecutive season.[134] He became the third player to finish as Ligue 1's top scorer for four seasons in a row. Mbappé also provided 17 assists in the season, becoming the first player to finish as both top scorer and top assist provider in the league's history.[135][136]

On 13 August 2022, Mbappé scored his first goal of the season for PSG in a 5–2 home victory over Montpellier, after having missed a penalty earlier in the match.[137] Eight days later, he scored his first hat-trick of the season in a 7–1 away win over Lille.[138] His first goal in the match was clocked at eight seconds, making it the second-fastest goal ever scored in Ligue 1 history, tenths of seconds later than Michel Rio's goal for Caen against Cannes in 1992.[139] On 6 September, Mbappé scored a brace in PSG's opening Champions League fixture against Juventus, securing a 2–1 home victory for the Parisians.[140] On 11 October, he scored a penalty in a 1–1 Champions League draw at home to Benfica, becoming the leading goalscorer for PSG in European competitions with 31 goals.[141] However, the match was played in the backdrop of media reports that Mbappé wanted to leave PSG in the January transfer window, rumours which he denied, saying, "I'm very happy. I never asked for my departure in January."[142]
On 23 January 2023, Mbappé became the first PSG player to score five goals in a match, including a ten-minute hat-trick, in a 7–0 rout of Pays de Cassel in the Coupe de France round of 32.[143] On 26 February, he scored two goals and assisted another as PSG defeated Marseille 3–0 in Le Classique. He thus became the club's joint all-time top goalscorer with 200 goals, equalizing Edinson Cavani's record.[144] In the following match, a 4–2 win over Nantes, he scored his 201st goal for PSG, taking the throne as the club's leading scorer.[145] He ended the Ligue 1 campaign with 29 goals, to become the top scorer for the fifth consecutive season, as PSG won their record 11th Ligue 1 title.[146][147] The forward also ended the season by receiving the Ligue 1 Player of the Year award for the fourth consecutive season, and featuring in the Ligue 1 Team of the Season.[148][149]

2023–24: Continuation despite rumoured departure
On 13 June 2023, via an official statement released through Agence France-Presse, Mbappé announced his decision not to renew his contract with PSG, which was set to expire in June 2024; according to him, the club had been informed about his decision since 15 July 2022.[150][151] In response to an article published by Le Parisien about his reported desire to join Real Madrid in the upcoming summer window, Mbappé tweeted that the rumours were "lies", reaffirming his intention to "continue at PSG next season, where [he is] very happy".[152] However, during the unveiling of new manager Luis Enrique on 5 July 2023, PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi clarified the club's stance on Mbappé, stating that "if [he wants] to stay [...] he [needs] to sign a new contract".[153] On 21 July, Mbappé was excluded from PSG's preseason tour in Japan.[154][155][156] After much speculation surrounding his future at Paris Saint-Germain, a statement from the club on 13 August 2023 confirmed Mbappé's reintegration into the first team.[157] This followed "constructive and positive discussions" between the player and the club ahead of their match against Lorient.[158]
Mbappé eventually made his first appearance of the 2023–24 season in a 1–1 draw away to Toulouse on 19 August, scoring his team's only goal, PSG's first of the season.[159] On 26 August, he scored his 150th and 151st Ligue 1 goals for the club as PSG beat Lens 3–1 at home.[160] On 19 September, Mbappé scored PSG's first Champions League goal of the season in a 2–0 win over Borussia Dortmund.[161] He scored the opening goal in a 3–0 win over AC Milan on matchday three of the competition on 25 October.[162] On 11 November, Mbappé scored his first hat-trick of the season in a 3–0 win over Reims, lifting PSG to the top of the Ligue 1 table.[163] On 28 November, Mbappé scored a penalty eight minutes into stoppage time, to salvage a 1–1 draw against Newcastle United and keep PSG in the Champions League,[164] which proved to be crucial for the club, as they qualified to the knockout stages, following a 1–1 away draw against Borussia Dortmund on 13 December.[165]
On 3 January 2024, Mbappé scored the second goal in a 2–0 victory over Toulouse in the 2023 Trophée des Champions, securing his first trophy of the season. In the process, Mbappé became the all-time top goalscorer at the Parc des Princes, with his 111th goal surpassing Edinson Cavani's scoring record.[166][167] On 7 January 2024, Mbappé scored his first hat-trick of the year in a 9–0 thrashing of Revel in the round of 64 of the Coupe de France, becoming the club's all-time top scorer in the competition by bringing his goal tally to 30.[168] On 15 February, it was reported in the media that Mbappé had informed PSG that he intended to leave the club upon expiration of his contract in June 2024.[169] On 5 March, he scored a brace in a 2–1 win away to Real Sociedad in the round of 16 of the Champions League, securing PSG's qualification to the quarter-finals for the first time since the 2020–21 season.[170] Mbappé scored his second hat-trick of the regular season and his first of the year on 19 March in a 6–2 win away at Montpellier, taking him to 250 goals in all competitions for PSG.[171]

On 17 May 2018, Mbappé was called up to the France squad for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.[177] On 21 June 2018, he scored his first World Cup goal in Les Bleus' 1–0 group stage win over Peru. This made him the youngest French goalscorer in World Cup history, aged 19.[178] On 30 June 2018, he was named man of the match in a 4–3 win over Argentina in the round of 16, having won a penalty for his team and scored two goals.[179] Mbappé was the second teenager to score two goals in a World Cup match after Pelé in 1958.[180] In a post-match press conference, he stated: "It's flattering to be the second one after Pelé but let's put things into context – Pelé is in another category."[181] On 15 July, Mbappé scored with a 25-yard strike against Croatia in the 2018 World Cup final, with France gaining a 4–2 win.[182] He became the second teenager, after Pelé, to score in a World Cup final: moreover, having scored four goals in the tournament, he received the FIFA World Cup Best Young Player Award.[183] Pelé congratulated him on social media, saying quote, "welcome to the club".[184]
On 11 June 2019, Mbappé scored his 100th career goal in a 4–0 away win over Andorra in Euro 2020 qualifying.[185][186] On 5 September 2020, Mbappé scored the only goal for France in a 1–0 UEFA Nations League win against Sweden. However, two days after the game, he tested positive for COVID-19.[98] He returned to play for France in a 7–1 victory against Ukraine on 7 October 2020, scoring a goal.[187][188] One week later, he scored the match-winning goal in a 2–1 win against Croatia.[189] France topped their Nations League Group and qualified for the 2021 UEFA Nations League Finals.[190]
UEFA Euro 2020 was postponed for a year because of the COVID-19 pandemic.[191] On 18 May 2021, Mbappé was included in the France squad for UEFA Euro 2020, his second major international tournament.[192] On 15 June, he scored a goal and assisted another one, both of which were later deemed to be offside, in a group stage match against Germany. On 28 June, he provided the assist for Karim Benzema's first goal in France's match against Switzerland in the round of 16. After a 3–3 draw, the game went to a penalty shoot-out; Mbappé failed to score the decisive fifth penalty, and France were eliminated from the tournament.[193] The forward failed to score in any of the four games France played in the competition.[194]

2021–2023: Nations League title and second consecutive World Cup final

In the Nations League semi-final on 7 October 2021, Mbappé assisted Benzema and later scored a goal himself from the penalty spot to help France come from behind and defeat Belgium 3–2. In the process, he made his 50th appearance for Les Bleus at 22 years and nine-and-a-half months.[195] Three days later, in the final against Spain, he once again set-up Benzema to tie the match, and later scored the 2–1 winning goal for France to clinch their first title.[196] With two goals and two assists in the Nations League Finals, Mbappé was awarded the competition's Golden Boot, known as the "Alipay Top Scorer Trophy."[197]
On 13 November, Mbappé scored his first goals in the 2022 World Cup qualifiers by finding the net four times in an 8–0 win over Kazakhstan, as France booked their place for the tournament's finals.[198] His super hat-trick, which included a 32-minute first half hat-trick, was his first one in an international match, as well as the first competitive hat-trick scored for France since Dominique Rocheteau in 1985.[199] Three days later, Mbappé scored and served his fifth assist for Benzema in a row in a 2–0 away win over Finland in the last World Cup qualifier.[200][201]

Mbappé in a 2022 FIFA World Cup group stage match against Australia, November 2022
France kicked off their 2022 FIFA World Cup campaign in Qatar against Australia on 22 November 2022. In the match, Mbappé was involved in three of France's goals in a 4–1 victory; he was in the build-up for the second goal, scored the third – a header from an Ousmane Dembélé cross, and assisted Olivier Giroud for the fourth goal.[202] Four days later, Mbappé scored both of France's goals in a 2–1 victory over Denmark, securing qualification to the knockout stages and thus breaking the "World Cup Champions' Curse".[203] In the knockout round of sixteen against Poland, Mbappé scored two more goals, the first into the roof of the net from 16 yards and the second being a curling strike into the top corner, in a 3–1 win.[204]
After featuring in France's wins against England and Morocco, respectively, in the quarter and semi-finals, Mbappé became only the second player in history to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final, scoring three goals against Argentina in the 2022 World Cup final.[205] The Albiceleste had a 2–0 lead with just over ten minutes remaining, before the Frenchman scored twice in two minutes, the second being a volley after playing a one-two with Marcus Thuram. In extra time, Argentina would take the lead again, thanks to Mbappé's PSG teammate Messi, before the forward scored a penalty to make it 3–3, at just four minutes from the end of extra time. The match went to a penalty shoot-out; Mbappé scored his penalty, but France lost following misses by Kingsley Coman and Aurélien Tchouaméni.[206] Mbappé secured the tournament's Golden Boot with eight goals, and became the sixth all-time top goalscorer in World Cup history with twelve goals, tied with Pelé.[207] Having scored a goal in the 2018 final, Mbappé also became the outright top goalscorer in World Cup finals, with four goals, and his hat-trick was the first in a men's final since Geoff Hurst for England in 1966.[208][209]

2023–present: Captaincy and Euro qualification
On 21 March 2023, following the international retirement of Hugo Lloris, manager Didier Deschamps named Mbappé the new captain of France ahead of their UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying campaign.[210] Three days later, in his first match as captain, he led France to a 4–0 victory over the Netherlands, by assisting Antoine Griezmann's goal and scoring a brace.[211] On 19 June, Mbappé scored a penalty in a 1–0 win over Greece, his 40th goal for Les Bleus. On the same night, he also became the youngest player to make 70 appearances for France.[212] On 13 October, Mbappé scored two goals for France in a 2–1 win over the Netherlands, securing qualification to UEFA Euro 2024. He also surpassed Michel Platini to become France's fourth all-time top scorer.[213] On 18 November, Mbappé scored a hat-trick and provided three assists in a 14–0 victory over Gibraltar, France's largest-ever victory.[214] His third goal of the match, a long-range shot from "40 metres out", was his 300th career goal.[215] He also surpassed Griezmann as France's third all-time top scorer, reaching 46 goals.[216]

Player profile
Style of play
Mbappé's explosive movement is often highlighted as one of his most important assets
A versatile forward, Mbappé often plays as a winger, and is capable of playing on either flank, due to his ability with both feet.[217][218] He is capable of cutting into the centre onto his stronger right foot from the left wing, and of creating chances and providing assists for teammates from the right thanks to his vision.[219][220][221][222] He is also able to play in the centre as a main striker, due to his composure, clinical finishing, and eye for goal.[223][224][225][226]
A highly skillful player, Mbappé is known for his dribbling ability, as well as his explosive acceleration, agility, quick feet, first touch, link-up play and creativity when in possession of the ball, as demonstrated by his use of elaborate feints, such as step overs, or sudden changes of pace or direction to beat opponents in one-on-one situations.[227][228][229] He is highly regarded for his pace and close ball control when dribbling at speed, as well as his movement, tactical intelligence, and ability to beat the defensive line by making attacking runs into space both on and off the ball.[219][228] His ability to time his runs enables him to stretch opposing defences, making him a dangerous offensive threat on counter-attacks.[219][228][230][231]
During the beginning of his career, Mbappé was compared to various greats in the history of football. He was described by Arsène Wenger as a "huge football talent" who "has similar qualities" to Thierry Henry.[232] His talent and stand-out performances for France at the 2018 World Cup also led him to be compared to Pelé in the media.[233] Former France international Nicolas Anelka said that Mbappé's ability to run at defences reminded him of Ronaldo's performances at the 1996 Olympics, and that Mbappé had the characteristics of a "world-class player".[234]

Reception
Often regarded as the best player in the world since the decline of the Messi–Ronaldo dominance, Mbappé is generally viewed as one of the best players of his generation, if not the best.[235][236][237] His individual and collective achievements, as well as his precocious development, has drawn much appraisal. Former French international Rio Mavuba remarked that if Mbappé had won the 2022 World Cup "he’d probably be the best French player (ever)", further saying "I love [Zinedine] Zidane but imagine, 23 years old, two World Cups, he’d be the best.”[238] During that same World Cup, Fox Sports deemed Mbappé as already one of the "World Cup's all-time greats" and "the best player in the world".[239]
Mbappé was named the fastest player in the world in a ranking by French newspaper Le Figaro.[240] Central defender and Dutch international Stefan de Vrij cited the Frenchman as "his toughest opponent" ahead of anyone else, including Mbappé's childhood idol Cristiano Ronaldo.[241] In 2018, the forward was considered the world's most expensive player from a transfer value perspective by the CIES.[242] His performances for his club and national team have seen him shortlisted for the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year in 2019[243] and 2023.[244][245]

Personal life
Mbappé is a practising Christian.[246] In a 2018 interview with Time, he spoke about the sacrifices he made as a teenager to focus on his football development: "I did not have the moments of so-called normal people during adolescence, like going out with friends, enjoying good times." But despite missing out on a "normal" life, Mbappé states he is "living the life he always dreamed of".[247]
Just over four years after making his professional debut, he had over 50 million followers on Instagram.[247] As of 2023, he has over 100 million followers on Instagram.[248] While he admits his "life has been totally turned upside down" since he first entered the spotlight, he says he is "happy".[247] He is fluent in French, English, and Spanish.[249]

Outside football
Media and sponsorship
Mbappé has a sponsorship deal with sportswear and equipment supplier Nike. In 2017, aged 18, he partnered with the brand to launch his own football boots, the Kylian Mbappé Nike Hypervenom 3.[250] In 2018, he unveiled the Nike Mercurial Superfly VI boots, which were inspired by the R9 Mercurial boots of former Brazilian striker Ronaldo.[251] In 2018, Swiss watchmaker Hublot signed Mbappé as a global ambassador.[252]
Mbappé has featured in EA Sports' FIFA video game series: on FIFA 18, he had the highest potential rating of 94.[253] His trademark goal celebration – posing with his arms folded and hands tucked under his armpits – was inspired by his younger brother Ethan, who would celebrate in this manner when beating Kylian at FIFA.[254][255] The celebration was first inserted in FIFA 19.[256] Mbappé featured as the cover star of FIFA 21, making him the youngest to appear on the cover solo.[257]
In 2023, he was included by Time among the 100 most influential people in the world;[258] in the same year, he was ranked third in the Forbes list of the world's highest-paid athletes.[259]

Philanthropy
Mbappé (pictured receiving his FIFA World Cup young player award next to French president Emmanuel Macron) met with the president in February 2018 to discuss a sports project in Africa.
On 22 February 2018, Mbappé was joined by former African strikers George Weah and Didier Drogba in a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron and FIFA president Gianni Infantino at the Élysée Palace in Paris, which focused on a sports development project in Africa.[260] Mbappé stated that the development of African sport is important to him due to his parents' African origins.[261]
On 28 January 2019, Mbappé donated $34,000 (around £26,000) to a crowdfunding campaign to finance a private search mission to find football player Emiliano Sala, whose light aircraft had gone missing over the English Channel a week earlier.[262] Later, on 10 February 2019, Mbappé donated a further £27,000 to the GoFundMe campaign created to fund the search for the plane's still-missing pilot, David Ibbotson.[263]
On 19 November 2021, Mbappé and Chinese diver Zhang Jiaqi became godfather and godmother, respectively, to two baby pandas at Beauval Zoo, as part of a campaign to raise awareness about the species.[264]

*Club domestic league appearances and goals, correct as of 20:15, 26 February 2024 (UTC)
Karim Mostafa Benzema (Arabic: كريم مصطفى بن زيما; born 19 December 1987) is a French professional footballer who plays as a striker for and captains Saudi Pro League club Al-Ittihad. Regarded as one of the best strikers of all time, he is a creative forward known for his technical skills, vision and versatility on the field,[4][5][6] Benzema is Real Madrid's all-time second-highest goalscorer and top assist provider.[7] He won 24 trophies with Real Madrid, including four La Liga, three Copa del Rey, and five UEFA Champions League titles.
Born in Lyon to parents of Algerian descent, Benzema began his career with hometown club Lyon in 2005, contributing sporadically to three Ligue 1 title wins. In 2008, he was named the league's Player of the Year and in the Team of the Year having finished as the league's top goalscorer and winning his fourth league title and first Coupe de France. In 2009, Benzema was the subject of a then-French record football transfer when he joined Real Madrid in a deal worth €35 million. After struggling to establish himself in his debut season, he eventually achieved a consistent goalscoring rate with the club, notably being part of a highly rated trio alongside Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale — dubbed "BBC" — who were integral to four Champions League wins from 2014 to 2018.
Following Ronaldo's departure in 2018, Benzema transitioned from the false 9 position into a sole striker. He was named in the La Liga Team of the Season for five consecutive years from 2018 to 2023, won La Liga Best Player twice and the Pichichi Trophy for the first time in 2022. Benzema finished as Champions League top scorer as he won his fifth title in 2022, and subsequently captained the club in his final season before signing for Al-Ittihad the following year.
A French international, Benzema won the 2004 UEFA European Under-17 Championship and made his senior debut for France in 2007, at age 19. He earned 97 caps, including scoring in three and appearing in four major tournaments, and ranks as France's sixth-highest all-time top goalscorer. Benzema was controversially left out of the squad for the 2010 World Cup and did not play for France for over five years after being implicated in a blackmailing scandal in 2015; he later returned to the squad before announcing his international retirement in December 2022. He has been named French Player of the Year by France Football four times. For his performances in 2021 and 2022, Benzema was awarded the UEFA Player of the Year and the Ballon d'Or, becoming the fifth French player to have won the Ballon d'Or.[8] At 34 years and 302 days old, he is the third-oldest winner of the award.


Club career
Early career
Benzema began his football career at his hometown club Bron Terraillon at the age of eight. While at the club, he was nicknamed "Coco" by friends and, after scoring two goals in an under-ten match against the Lyon youth academy, began attracting attention from the biggest club in the city.[9][10] According to Serge Santa Cruz, who was president of Bron Terraillon in the 1990s, Lyon officials had visited him directly in an attempt to sign the youngster; however, Santa Cruz refused.[11] After talking with Benzema's father, the club allowed the player to undergo a trial with Lyon.[11] Following the trial, Benzema officially joined Lyon and was inserted into the club's academy.[12]

Lyon
Benzema quickly ascended up the youth categories in the academy. He served as a ballboy during Lyon senior team matches and performed well in school being described as a student who was "discreet and respectful".[11][13] At under-16 level, Benzema scored 38 goals in the Championnat National des 16 ans, the domestic league for under-16 youth players in France.[14] Ahead of the 2004–05 season, Benzema was promoted to the club's reserve team, which was playing in the Championnat de France amateur, the fourth division of French football. Despite only playing with the team during the autumn campaign, he scored a team-high ten goals as the Lyon reserve team finished second in its group.[15]

2004–2007: Breakthrough and three league titles
Benzema was called up to the senior team for the first time under manager Paul Le Guen during the break leading up to the second half of the season. As is customary with new players arriving at Lyon, the young striker had to stand up and speak to his new teammates, which at that time included the likes of Michael Essien, Sylvain Wiltord, Florent Malouda and Eric Abidal.[16] While speaking, Benzema was subjected to jokes and laughter, which prompted the youngster to declare, "Do not laugh, I'm here to take your place."[16] He made his professional debut on 15 January 2005 against Metz, appearing as a substitute for Pierre-Alain Frau. Lyon won the match 2–0 as Benzema provided the assist of the second goal scored by Bryan Bergougnoux.[10][17] He signed his first professional contract the same month, agreeing to a three-year deal.[18] After making three more appearances as a substitute, on 2 April Benzema made his first professional start in a 1–0 win over Lens.[19] He finished the campaign with six appearances as Lyon won their fourth-straight league title.
Benzema began the 2005–06 season under the tutelage of new manager Gérard Houllier. Under Houllier, he struggled for meaningful minutes due to the presence of newly signed Brazilian striker Fred, as well as Sylvain Wiltord. Benzema made his season debut on 2 October 2005 in a league win over Rennes, appearing as a substitute.[20] On 6 December, he made his UEFA Champions League debut in Lyon's final group stage match against Norwegian club Rosenborg. On his competition debut, he scored his first professional goal in a 2–1 win.[21] A month later, Benzema scored his first professional double in a 4–0 win over Grenoble in the Coupe de France.[22] On 4 March 2006, Benzema scored his first professional league goal against Ajaccio in a 3–1 win.[23]
Benzema began earning more playing time in the 2006–07 season and made his competitive season debut in the 2006 Trophée des Champions against Paris Saint-Germain. In the French Supercup, Benzema converted a penalty which drew the match at 1–1. Lyon later won the league curtain-raiser 5–4 on penalties.[24] Benzema opened the league campaign on a quick note scoring in the team's first match of the season against Nantes.[25] Three weeks later, on 26 August 2006, Benzema appeared as a substitute and scored two goals in a 4–1 away win over Nice.[26] He also converted two goals in the Champions League group stage against Romanian outfit Steaua București and Ukrainian club Dynamo Kyiv.[27][28] After appearing regularly during the autumn campaign, on 10 November, Benzema suffered a severe thigh injury.[29] The injury resulted in the striker missing three months of action before returning in February 2007. Benzema failed to score a goal until the final league match of the season against Nantes as Lyon recorded its sixth consecutive league title.[30]

2007–2009: Club talisman
For the 2007–08 season, with Florent Malouda, John Carew and Sylvain Wiltord all departing from the club, Benzema switched to the number 10 shirt and was inserted into the lead striker role. After forming a special relationship with new manager Alain Perrin, he responded with 31 goals in 51 games. He topped the league with 20 goals, scored four goals in the Champions League, one in the Coupe de la Ligue and totaled six goals in six Coupe de France matches, helping Lyon win their first ever double.[31] Some of his more dazzling performances that season included a hat-trick against Metz on 15 September,[32] an equalizing goal in the 90th minute from a free kick against Derby du Rhône rivals Saint-Étienne,[33] and a goal against Lens that was nominated for goal of the season by fans.
In the Champions League, Benzema scored an important double against Rangers at Ibrox Stadium on the last match day of the group stage. The 3–0 victory assured Lyon progression to the knockout rounds.[34] In the knockout rounds, Lyon faced Manchester United and Benzema continued to score, this time it was from outside the penalty box in the first leg match which ended in a 1–1 draw[35] and United eventually won the tie 1–2 on aggregate. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson and players praised Benzema for his performance.[36] Lyon club president Jean-Michel Aulas later accused Ferguson of tapping-up Benzema.[37]
On 13 March 2008, Benzema extended his contract with Lyon until 2013 with a one-year extension option.[38] After signing his new contract, Benzema became one of the highest paid footballers in France.[39] For his efforts that season, he was named the Ligue 1 Player of the Year, selected to the Team of the Year and awarded the Trophée du Meilleur Buteur for being the league's top scorer.[40][41] He won the 2008 Bravo Award given to the most outstanding young footballer playing in Europe,[42] and was also shortlisted by France Football for the 2008 Ballon d'Or award,[43] eventually won by Cristiano Ronaldo.
Benzema got off to a good start for the 2008–09 season, scoring twice in Lyon's opening league match against Toulouse.[44] The following three weeks, he scored goals against Rhône-Alpes rivals Grenoble[45] and Saint-Étienne[46] and scored a goal against Nice, converting a penalty in the dying seconds.[47] Lyon won all three matches. As a result of his early goals, Lyon club president Jean-Michel Aulas quelled the many transfer rumors surrounding Benzema by placing a €100 million price tag on the striker. He was also nominated alongside Franck Ribéry to be featured on the French cover of the video game FIFA 09.[48]

He scored his seventh goal of the league on 29 October, scoring in the 2–0 win over Sochaux. Benzema scored again the following weekend in a 2–0 win over Le Mans.[49] He was among the top scorers in the Champions League group stage, scoring five goals,[50] a double against Steaua București,[51] two goals in two matches against Fiorentina,[52][53] and a goal against the eventual group winners Bayern Munich on the final match day.[54]
Following the winter break, Benzema endured a rough patch going scoreless the first three games before recording his 11th goal of the season against Nice in a 3–1 victory.[55] Two weeks later, he scored his 12th goal against Nancy in a 2–0 victory.[56] The next nine matches, both Benzema and Lyon's form dwindled losing four matches, drawing three and winning only two with Benzema scoring only two goals in that stretch, both of them against Le Mans in a 3–1 victory.[57] The bad form resulted in Lyon losing their grip on first-place position and eventually falling out of the title race, thus ending their streak of seven consecutive Ligue 1 titles.[58] Benzema was a part of four of those title runs.
Despite losing the title, Benzema got back on track scoring his 15th and 16th goals of the season on 17 May in a 3–1 away victory over rivals Marseille, the first goal being a penalty.[59] He scored his 17th goal the following weekend against Caen in a 3–1 victory moving him into third place among Ligue 1 top scorers.[60]

Real Madrid
2009–10: Transfer and adapting to Spain
On 1 July 2009, it was announced that Lyon had reached an agreement with Spanish club Real Madrid for the transfer of Benzema. The transfer fee was priced at €35 million with the fee rising to as much as €41 million based on incentives.[61][62][63][64] On 9 July, Benzema successfully passed his medical and signed his contract, a six-year deal, later that afternoon.[65] He was presented officially as a Real Madrid player later that night at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, similarly to the previous signings of Kaká and Cristiano Ronaldo.[66] Benzema made his Real Madrid debut on 20 July in the club's opening pre-season friendly against Irish team Shamrock Rovers in Dublin, appearing as a half-time substitute.[67] He scored the lone goal in the club's 1–0 win, scoring in the 87th minute.[68] On 24 August, Benzema netted two goals in Real Madrid's 4–0 victory over Norwegian club Rosenborg in an annual friendly tournament organized for the Santiago Bernabeu Trophy.[69] The goals brought his total tally in the pre-season with Real Madrid to five, making him the joint top scorer alongside fellow striker Raúl.[70]
Benzema made his league debut for Madrid on 29 August 2009 against Deportivo La Coruña. He started the match, but was substituted out in the second half as Madrid won 3–2.[71] A month later, he scored his first goal for the club in a 5–0 victory against newly promoted Xerez.[72] After missing the mid-week match against Villarreal, against Tenerife at the weekend, Benzema scored his first double for Madrid in a 3–0 home victory.[73] He made his Champions League debut for the club on 30 September in a group stage tie against Marseille.[74] After failing to score a goal in the month of October, in the team's first match in November against Italian club Milan in the Champions League, Benzema scored the opener to give Madrid a 1–0 lead. His goal was later cancelled out by a Ronaldinho penalty.[75]

Benzema playing against Marseille in a 2009 Champions League match
In late November, Benzema began appearing mainly as a substitute as manager Manuel Pellegrini preferred Gonzalo Higuaín in the lead striker role. To coincide with his benching, the striker was also being criticized by the Spanish media for his under-performance and difficulties settling in the country as he had not yet begun learning the Spanish language.[76][77] He was even declared the "new Anelka" by a Marca blogger, referring to former Real Madrid striker Nicolas Anelka who had a tumultuous year at the club before being sold.[78] Benzema was defended by his compatriot Zinedine Zidane, who admitted "after two months, I was also criticized" and that Benzema was "a talented player and talented players in Madrid must win".[79]
On 5 December, Benzema appeared as a substitute for Rafael van der Vaart and scored the third goal in a 6–0 romp of Almería.[80] The day after the match against Almería, Benzema responded to the criticism by stating, "I am totally integrated and very happy at Real Madrid", and, "Yes, I have improved my adaptation. I have a new home and I'm learning Spanish to understand myself better with my teammates."[81] After nearly a month coming off of the bench, he started alongside Higuaín away to Valencia on 12 December.[82] A week later, Benzema returned to the bench. Following an injury to Higuaín in early January 2010, Pellegrini inserted Benzema back into the starting lineup.[83] After failing to score in his first two starts in the absence of Higuaín, against Deportivo La Coruña on 30 January, he scored a double in an important 3–1 away win.[84][85] Following the return of Higuaín, Benzema was relegated back to a substitute's role and finished the campaign by making eight consecutive appearances off the bench. Included in one of those appearances was his final goal of the season against Athletic Bilbao in a 5–1 win.[86]

2010–11: First-team mainstay
Benzema playing in a league match against Villarreal in 2011
Ahead of the 2010–11 season, Benzema switched to the number 9 shirt as Real Madrid were under the tutelage of new incoming manager José Mourinho. The striker immediately drew the ire of Mourinho who declared to reporters during a pre-season media session that "Benzema must understand that he is extremely talented, but that in itself is not enough", while also stating that "[Madrid] need a striker who is sparky, not one that is listless".[87] Mourinho sentiments were later echoed by incoming France national team coach Laurent Blanc who acknowledged that Benzema was "not used to working".[88] Blanc also stated that the striker needed to shed weight in order to fulfill his potential.[89]
Due to Mourinho preferring Ronaldo and Higuaín as his forwards,[88] Benzema began the campaign as a substitute coming off the bench in the team's opening league match of the season against Mallorca.[90] Following the September international break, he made his first start in a 1–0 win over Osasuna.[91] On 21 September, Benzema made a substitute appearance and scored his first goal of the season in a 3–0 home win against Espanyol.[92] Afterwards, the striker failed to score a domestic goal for nearly two months.[citation needed]

On 10 November, Benzema scored his second goal of the campaign against Real Murcia in the 2010–11 edition of the Copa del Rey.[93] In late November, Benzema was inserted into the starting eleven following a severe back injury to Higuaín, along with the team's lack of senior strikers. In his first match since being inserted into the starting lineup permanently, he scored his first Champions League goal of the season in a group stage fixture against Dutch club Ajax.[94] In Madrid's final group stage tie against Auxerre, Benzema scored his first hat trick for the club in a 4–0 win. The first goal he scored was Real Madrid's 300th goal in the Champions League era.[95][96] Two weeks later, Benzema converted another hat trick, this time in an 8–0 thrashing of Levante in the Copa del Rey.[97] In late January, for the first time in his Real Madrid career, Benzema scored goals in back-to-back matches. On 23 January, he scored the only goal in a 1–0 win at home against Mallorca.[98] Three days later, Benzema repeated his efforts scoring the only goal in a win over Sevilla in the first leg of the team's Copa del Rey semi-final tie.[99] Real Madrid later advanced to its 37th Copa del Rey final in club history after beating Sevilla 2–0 in the second leg.[100]
Following the arrival of Emmanuel Adebayor on loan, Benzema went unused in two consecutive league matches in February 2011. He returned to the starting lineup on 19 February and embarked on a run in which he scored ten goals in eight matches. Included in those ten goals were doubles in three straight matches against Málaga, Racing Santander and Hércules, as well as a goal in the first leg of Madrid's Round of 16 tie against former club Lyon.[101][102][103] The strike against his hometown club was the 100th goal of his professional career, and also the first goal for Real Madrid at the Stade de Gerland in six years, though despite the honours associated with netting the goal, Benzema did not celebrate out of respect for his former club.[104]

Benzema playing in a league match against 
Almería in 2011
On 19 March, he scored the opener in the El Derbi madrileño as Real Madrid went on to win the match 2–1.[105] Despite his form, Benzema appeared in only one of the four highly anticipated matches against El Clásico rivals Barcelona, in which the two clubs met in the league, the 2011 Copa del Rey Final and the Champions League knockout stage. In between those clashes, on 23 April 2011, Benzema scored a goal in a 6–3 win over Valencia.[106] On 30 April, he scored a goal in the team's 3–2 loss to Real Zaragoza.[107] It was the only match of the campaign that Real Madrid lost, in which Benzema scored. To close out the campaign, Benzema scored another double in an 8–1 win over Almería.[108] He finished the campaign second on the team behind Ronaldo with 26 goals as Real Madrid captured the Copa del Rey giving Benzema his first honour with the club.[109] For his performances during the campaign, particularly during the second half, Benzema was praised by Mourinho, club officials Florentino Pérez and Emilio Butragueño, as well as national team manager Laurent Blanc.[110][111][112]

2011–12: First La Liga championship
Prior to the start of the 2011–12 season, Benzema, taking the advice of compatriots Blanc and Zidane,[113][114] ventured to Merano, Italy, to attend a high performance clinic where he underwent treatment to reduce his weight.[115] The spell at the clinic was ultimately a success after the striker arrived at pre-season 8 kilograms (18 lb) lighter.[115] While at the clinic, Benzema also underwent physical training to build up his muscle mass.[115] The striker was impressive in the pre-season scoring eight goals in seven matches.[116] His performances during the pre-season resulted in Mourinho naming him the starting lead striker for the new campaign. Mourinho was later credited with Benzema's transformation,[117] but denied full responsibility and, instead, gave credit to the striker himself.[118]
In the second leg of the 2011 Supercopa de España against Barcelona, and with Madrid trailing 4–3 on aggregate late in the match, Benzema scored the equalizing goal to even the tie at 4–4. However, six minutes later, a Lionel Messi strike gave Barcelona the supercup.[119] In the team's second league match of the season against Getafe, Benzema scored a double in a 4–2 victory.[120] After going goalless in three consecutive league matches, he scored his third league goal of the campaign against Rayo Vallecano in a 4–2 win.[121] In the team's ensuing match against Ajax in the Champions League, Benzema scored Madrid's third goal in a 3–0 home win.[122] In the club's next Champions League match against Lyon, Benzema scored again by netting the opener in a 4–0 win against Lyon.[123]

Benzema training ahead of a Champions League match in 2012
In November 2011, Benzema scored five goals; three in the league and two in Europe. In the league, he converted his three goals in wins over Osasuna and Valencia, while he scored his two Champions League goals in a 6–2 group stage win over Croatian club Dinamo Zagreb.[124][125][126] On 10 December 2011, Benzema scored the opener in Madrid's 3–1 defeat to Barcelona in the El Clásico.[127] The goal, scored just 21 seconds into the match, was the fastest goal ever scored in a match between the two rivals.[128] Three days after his record-breaking goal, for his performances during the 2011 calendar year, Benzema was named the France Football French Player of the Year, beating out Barcelona defender Eric Abidal and Lyon goalkeeper Hugo Lloris.[129] He became only the second French player based in Spain to win the award, and also the second Real Madrid player to capture it. Zidane was the first to achieve both honorable mentions. Benzema expressed gratitude at winning the award, stating, "It is a pleasure to win an individual trophy. When I see the previous winners – Zidane, Henry and other major players – it makes me proud to join them on the list."[130] In the team's next match after winning the award, against Sevilla, Benzema assisted two goals in a 6–2 triumph.[131]
Benzema opened the 2012 portion of the campaign in positive form. He scored goals against Granada and Málaga.[132] Benzema scored against the latter club in the Copa del Rey in each leg of the Round of 16.[133][134] The 4–2 aggregate win advanced Real Madrid to the quarter-finals where the club faced Barcelona. After failing to score in the first leg, which ended 2–1 in favour of Barça,[135] in the second leg on 25 January 2012, Benzema scored his third goal of the season against the Blaugrana, but Madrid failed to win the tie losing 4–3 on aggregate.[136] On 12 February, Benzema scored his first league goal in over a month against Levante.[137] A week later, he scored a double in a 4–0 shutout of Racing Santander.[138] On 24 March, Benzema scored two goals in a league win over Real Sociedad.[139] The two goals made him the top French scorer in La Liga history surpassing Zidane.[140] Three days later, Benzema scored another double in a 3–0 first leg away win over Cypriot team APOEL in the Champions League quarter-finals.[141] On 29 April, Benzema put in a masterful performance scoring two goals and assisting another in a 3–0 win over Sevilla. The double was his seventh of the season and allowed Madrid to close in on its first Primera Division title in four years.[142] Los Blancos captured their 32nd league title the following week cruising to a 3–0 win over Athletic Bilbao.[143] Benzema appeared as a second-half substitute in the match.[144]

2012–2016: Sustained continental success
On the first matchday of the Champions League, Benzema scored an equalizer against Manchester City in 3–2 win at Santiago Bernabéu.

International career
Youth
Benzema is a former France youth international having earned caps at all levels for which he was eligible, excluding the under-16 team. He is a member of the group, commonly known in France as the Génération 1987, a youth class that produced current internationals Hatem Ben Arfa, Jérémy Ménez and Samir Nasri, alongside himself.[240] Benzema was the last of the four to make his youth international debut under coach Philippe Bergeroo and officially joined the team ahead of the 2004 UEFA European Under-17 Championship that was played on home soil. In the competition, he appeared in two matches. On his tournament debut, Benzema scored the opening goal in a 3–1 win over Northern Ireland.[241] His lone other appearance in the competition was in a 1–0 group stage win over Spain as France went on to win the tournament defeated the same team in the final.[242][243]
Benzema was a regular starter in the team at under-18 level. He made his debut with the team at a local tournament in the Czech Republic. Benzema scored his first goal at under-18 level in the competition against Poland in the team's final group stage match.[244] In the final against the hosts, he scored the opening goal in a 2–0 win as France were declared champions of the competition.[245] On 30 September 2004, Benzema was one of three goalscorers in France's 3–0 away win over Norway.[246] In the team's next match against Russia, he scored a double in a 3–1 victory.[247] Due to France winning the 2004 U17 European title, the under-18 team was allowed participation in the 2005 Meridian Cup. Benzema was called up to the team for the competition and played in all four matches, scoring a tournament-high five goals as France were crowned champions of the tournament.[248] He opened the tournament by scoring two goals in a 7–0 victory over Cameroon.[249] After going scoreless in the team's next match against Sierra Leone, Benzema responded by scoring a goal in a shutout victory over Nigeria and netting another double in a 4–1 win against Egypt.[250][251] On 19 May 2005, in the team's final match of the season against Slovakia, Benzema scored all four goals in a 4–1 victory.[252] He finished the under-18 campaign with 18 appearances and a team-high 14 goals and was, subsequently, praised by Bergeroo who, following the campaign, declared that Benzema was "quite efficient".[253]
The foursome of Benzema, Ben Arfa, Ménez and Nasri returned to international play together for under-19 duty. The four were joined by Issiar Dia, Blaise Matuidi and Serge Gakpé with the objective of winning the 2006 UEFA European Under-19 Championship. The team opened the campaign with two friendly matches against Norway. Over the course of the two matches, Benzema scored one goal, which came in the first match, a 4–0 win.[254] In the first round of qualification for the UEFA-sanctioned tournament, he scored his only goal in the final group match against Austria.[255] France won the match 2–0, which resulted in the team progressing to the Elite Round.[256] In the ensuing round, France were placed in a relatively easy group alongside Scotland, Bulgaria, and Belarus. In the opening group game against Bulgaria, Benzema scored a double converting a penalty and scoring in play as France won 4–0.[257] Both of his goals were scored within a minute of each other.[258] After surprisingly drawing 0–0 with Belarus, France faced Scotland in the final group stage match. Benzema opened the scoring in the 11th minute, but his goal was cancelled out by Steven Fletcher in the second half.[259] The match ultimately finished 1–1 and, despite finishing the round undefeated, France were eliminated after being beaten on points by the Scots.[260]
Benzema made his under-21 debut for Les Espoirs under coach René Girard in the team's first match following the 2006 UEFA European Under-21 Championship against Belgium. He started the match and was replaced at half-time by Yoann Gourcuff.[261] He featured in qualification matches for the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Championship and appeared as a starter and substitute in the first leg and second leg, respectively, of the team's surprising defeat to Israel in the qualifying playoffs.[262][263] Despite still being eligible to represent the under-21 team until 2009, his appearance in the second leg defeat to Israel was Benzema's last with the team and he finished his under-21 career with five appearances and no goals. Prior to representing France at senior international level, Benzema was courted by the Algerian Football Federation (FAF) who sought for the player to represent Algeria at senior international level. In December 2006, the striker was approached by former federation president Hamid Haddadj and then-national team coach Jean-Michel Cavalli, but turned down the invitation citing his desire to continue his international career with France.[264] Benzema later told French radio station Radio Monte Carlo "Algeria is my parents' country and it is in my heart, but football-wise, I will only play for the French national team".[265]

Senior
Euro 2008
Benzema playing for France in 2008
Benzema was called up for the first time to the senior national team by Raymond Domenech on 9 November 2006 for the team's friendly match against Greece that would be played on 15 November. Benzema described the call-up as "a reward", while also stating "I am pleased, of course, me and my family. A (the senior national team), is the national team's highest honor".[266] Two days before the match, he was forced to withdraw from the team due to a thigh injury, which he suffered while playing domestically for Lyon.[267] After failing to make the squad for the team's February 2007 match against Argentina, Benzema returned to the team in March for a UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying match against Lithuania and a friendly against Austria.[268] After failing to appear in the qualifier, he made his international debut on 28 March 2007 against Austria. Benzema appeared as a half-time substitute for Djibril Cissé and scored the only goal of the match after a free-kick from Samir Nasri.[269] On 13 October, Benzema scored a double in a 6–0 win against the Faroe Islands.[270] After appearing regularly in the team for the rest of the 2007–08 season, he was named to the 23-man squad to participate in UEFA Euro 2008.
Benzema made his debut in the competition on 9 June 2008 in the team's opening match against Romania. Benzema started the match, but was substituted out for Nasri in the second half after a frustrating performance.[271] The match finished 0–0 and Benzema was, subsequently, criticized by the French media for his performance with newspaper Le Point declaring that Benzema was "unrecognizable" and that he "symbolized the impotence of France in the attack".[272] The newspaper also cited his lack of international experience for his subdued performance. In the team's next group game against the Netherlands, Benzema played no part in the 4–1 defeat.[273] He returned to the team in its final group game against Italy and was given a place in the starting lineup.[274] However, France lost 2–0 and were eliminated from the competition.[275]
In November 2008, Benzema, among several other young players in the team, was accused of being insolent during the team's campaign at the European Championship. The accusation came from international teammate William Gallas who inserted the charge in his autobiography. Though most of Gallas' accusations were directed at Nasri,[276][277][278] during the competition, it was reported by newspaper Le Parisien that several of the national team players described Benzema as "arrogant" and that the striker was scolded by midfielder Claude Makélélé following the team's loss to the Netherlands.[279]

2010 World Cup omission
Despite the reports from after Euro 2008, Benzema remained a regular in the team and, ahead of qualification for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, switched to the number ten shirt after previously wearing the number nine.[280] In the team's first match following its elimination from Euro 2008, Benzema scored a goal in a 3–2 friendly win over Sweden in Gothenburg.[281] Two months later, he scored another goal in a 3–1 victory against Tunisia at the Stade de France.[282] On 5 June 2009, Benzema converted the only goal of the match, a penalty shot, in a 1–0 win over Turkey at the Stade de Gerland, his home stadium.[283] He scored his first World Cup qualification goals in victories over the Faroe Islands and Austria in October 2009. His cap against Austria would be his last of the Domenech era as he failed to make France's preliminary 30-man squad for the World Cup. Domenech cited Benzema's struggle for form with his new club Real Madrid, rather than his alleged involvement in a sex scandal as his reason for leaving the striker out.[284] Prior to the list being unveiled, Benzema informed Radio Monte Carlo that if he was not selected he would be "very disappointed, but not killed" and "I will support the France team no matter what".[285]

Euro 2012
Benzema playing for France at UEFA Euro 2012
Following the World Cup, Benzema returned to the national team under the reign of new coach Laurent Blanc. Blanc, an admirer of Benzema, sought to build the attack around the striker and, after going almost a year without representing France, Benzema made his return to the team in its 2–1 defeat to Norway in Oslo.[286][287] Alongside Gourcuff, Benzema led the team in scoring in qualifying for UEFA Euro 2012, netting three. He scored his three goals in wins over Bosnia and Herzegovina, Luxembourg, and Albania.[288][289][290] On 17 November 2010, Benzema scored the opening goal in France's 2–1 win over England at Wembley Stadium.[291] In the team's next match against Brazil in February 2011, he scored the only goal for France in a 1–0 win.[292] After appearing regularly in qualifying for Euro 2012, on 29 May 2012, Benzema was named to the squad to participate in the competition.[293] On 5 June, in the team's final warm-up friendly ahead of the European Championship, Benzema scored two goals in a 4–0 shutout win over Estonia.[294] At Euro 2012, Benzema started the team's opening match against England, which ended in a 1–1 draw.[295] In the team's ensuing group stage match against Ukraine, he assisted both the goals in a 2–0 win.[296]

2014 World Cup
On 11 October 2013, Benzema scored his first goal for the France national team since June 2012 in a friendly against Australia, thus ending a scoring drought for his national team which had lasted 1,222 minutes. In that match played at the Parc des Princes in Paris, which France won 6–0, Benzema scored France's sixth and final goal in the 50th minute after turning home Franck Ribéry's left-wing cross.[297] In the second leg of the 2014 World Cup qualification play-off against Ukraine held on 19 November 2013 at the Stade de France, Benzema scored France's second goal in the 34th minute to level the aggregate score at 2–2. Benzema scored his goal when he side-footed home after a huge scramble in the Ukrainian penalty box, although he was shown on television replays to be offside by almost one metre when the ball took a final touch off Mathieu Valbuena's chest. Benzema had four minutes earlier been denied a legitimate goal, the offside flag wrongly raised when he turned in Ribéry's low cross into the net with his torso a metre from the Ukrainian goal-line. Ukraine had won the first leg of the play-off 2–0 in Kyiv just four days earlier. France would eventually win the second leg 3–0 to advance to the 2014 World Cup finals in Brazil with a 3–2 aggregate scoreline.[298]
On 6 June 2014, Benzema was named in France's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, making his debut in the tournament.[299] In the team's first match, a 3–0 win against Honduras in Porto Alegre on 15 June, he scored a goal in each half, the first from a penalty kick. He also took part in the team's second goal, when his shot rebounded off the post and was fumbled over the goal-line by Honduran goalkeeper Noel Valladares for an own goal, the first World Cup goal given by goal-line technology.[300] He was named by FIFA as man of the match for his performance.[301] In the second group fixture, he scored and had a penalty saved in a 5–2 defeat of Switzerland, as Les Bleus all but secured qualification to the knockout stage.[302] France were later knocked out by eventual winners Germany in the quarter-final stage of the tournament.[303]

2016–2020 exclusion
After last featuring for France in a 4–0 win against Armenia on 8 October 2015, French Football Federation announced on 13 April 2016 that Benzema would not be picked for Euro 2016 tournament on home soil.[304] This happened after a blackmailing affair involving fellow French team player Mathieu Valbuena (see §Controversies and legal issues). He responded on 1 June 2016 in Marca, in an interview entitled 'Benzema: "Deschamps folded due to pressure from France's racist element"'.[305]
Benzema was also left off the roster for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.[306] Directing his frustration at FFF president Noël Le Graët, Benzema later tweeted: "Mr Le Graët, with all due respect, you've lost an opportunity to remain silent. I've discovered your true face, and this isn't the one that said he appreciated me and wouldn't discuss the subject of team selections!"[307]
In November 2019, Benzema replied to Le Graët's comments that his career with France was over, by saying: "If you think I'm done, let me play with one of the other countries I am eligible for and we'll see".[308]

Return to the squad, Nations League victory and retirement
On 18 May 2021, following speculation from the media, Benzema was officially included in France's 26-man squad for UEFA Euro 2020, his first call-up to the national team in over five years.[309] He made his first appearance since his return on 2 June, in a 3–0 home win over Wales, in a friendly warm-up match before the final tournament, during which he missed a penalty, but was later also involved in the final goal scored by Antoine Griezmann.[310] On 23 June 2021, he scored a brace in a 2–2 draw against Portugal, to be his first goals in the European Championship.[311] He subsequently scored another brace in France's round-of-16 match against Switzerland, where France were knocked out of the tournament on penalties after a 3–3 draw.[312] With four goals in as many games, Benzema won the Euro 2020 bronze boot.[313]
In the 2021 UEFA Nations League semi-final on 7 October, Benzema scored France's first goal in the second half as they came from behind to defeat Belgium 3–2.[314] He overtook Zidane in the France scoring records as he scored his 32nd goal for Le Blues to become the 6th top scorer in their history.[315] In the Final three days later, he scored the temporary equaliser as France went on to clinch the title for the first time with a 2–1 victory over Spain;[316] he was named "Player of the Match" by UEFA for his performance in the final.[317] With two goals, he was the joint–top scorer of the Nations League Finals, along with Spain's Ferran Torres and teammate Kylian Mbappé, who won the top scorer trophy due to having also provided two assists – Benzema won the bronze boot due to playing more minutes than Torres.[318] The Nations League was Benzema's first trophy with France's senior team and his 27th of his career, making him the most decorated Frenchman in football history.[319]
On 13 November 2021, Benzema scored his first goals in the 2022 World Cup qualifiers with a brace in an 8–0 win over Kazakhstan as France booked their place for Qatar 2022.[320] His brace saw him over-take David Trezeguet to become Les Bleus' fifth all-time top scorer with 35 goals.[321] Although he was included in France's final squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, on 19 November, the French Football Federation stated that Benzema would be forced to miss the tournament due to a thigh injury.[322][323] Despite not taking part in the tournament, Benzema was still awarded the silver medal as he was not replaced by another player unlike Christopher Nkunku, who was replaced by Randal Kolo Muani.[324] On 19 December, Benzema announced his retirement from the national team.[325]

Style of play
Generally known for both his finishing and playmaking,[326] Benzema is regarded as one of the best strikers of all time.[4][5] He is a creative, skillful, quick, agile, and prolific forward, who is good in the air and capable of playing off the shoulders of the last defender,[327][328][329] and has been described as an "immensely talented striker" who is "strong and powerful" and "a potent finisher from inside the box" with either foot, as well as his head, despite being naturally right footed.[330][327] He is considered to be one of the best strikers of his generation, with his Real Madrid manager Ancelotti describing him "the best striker in the world" in 2021.[331][332]
An atypical number 9, although he is usually deployed as a centre forward, and can operate as an out-and-out striker, Benzema is also capable of playing in several other offensive positions, and has been used on the wing, or even as a playmaker behind the main striker, either in the number 10 role as an attacking midfielder, or as a deep-lying forward. In addition to his goalscoring, Benzema is known for his willingness and ability to drop into deeper or wider positions, and either link-up play with midfielders, or use his strength and technical ability to hold up the ball with his back to goal to provide assists for teammates, courtesy of his vision, creativity, passing, and eye for the final ball;[nb 1] his playing style led one commentator to describe him as a "nine and a half".[337] Highlighting his prolific goalscoring and his creative abilities, Benzema ranks as Madrid's all-time second-highest goalscorer and top assist provider, with 328 goals and 104 assists respectively.[7][338]
During his time at Madrid, Benzema has also been praised by pundits for his work-rate and tactical intelligence off the ball, as well as his positional sense and attacking movement as a forward, which often draws opposing defenders out of position, and in turn creates spaces for his teammates; as such, he formed a strong offensive partnership with Cristiano Ronaldo during the latter's time with the club. Indeed, Benzema's movement drew defenders away and created space for Ronaldo to make attacking runs into the centre of the area from the left wing, which essentially saw the Frenchman act as a false 9.[nb 2] Following Ronaldo's departure in 2018, he took on a new role as the club's main striker, playing with his back to goal less frequently, and instead receiving the ball facing the goal and taking more touches inside the penalty area; in this position, he also often drifted out wide onto the left flank, while he was able to utilise his control and touch on the ball effectively to create goalscoring opportunities for himself inside the box. The positional change saw an increase in his goalscoring output for the club and an improvement in his shooting, for which he had occasionally come under criticism from the press in the past, as demonstrated by the variety of his goals, his conversion rate, and his clinical finishing with his feet as well as his head; however, in addition to taking over the role of the team's main goalscorer, he also still continued to serve as link-up player for the team's front line by creating chances for his teammates.[342][343]

Personal life
Benzema in an Adidas music video (above) and a commercial (below) for Real Madrid in 2019 and 2018, respectively
Benzema was born in Lyon to French nationals of Algerian descent.[11][344] His grandfather, Da Lakehal Benzema, lived in the village of Tigzirt, located in the northern town of Aït Djellil in Algeria before migrating to Lyon, where he eventually settled in the 1950s.[345] Benzema's father, Hafid, was born in Tigzirt, while his mother, Wahida Djebbara, was born and raised in Lyon; her family originated from Oran. Benzema is the third youngest in the family and grew up with eight other siblings in Bron, an eastern suburb of Lyon.[345] His younger brothers Gressy and Sabri are also footballers.[346] The former plays at the amateur level with Vaulx-le-Velin in the Division d'Honneur, the sixth division of French football, while the latter plays in the youth academy of a club in the family's hometown of Bron.[347][348]
On 3 February 2014, his then-girlfriend Chloé de Launay gave birth to their daughter Mélia in Madrid.[349] On 5 May 2017, his girlfriend Cora Gauthier gave birth to their son Ibrahim.[350] A practicing Muslim, Benzema observes fasting during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.[351] He has spoken about his faith saying: "My faith helps me to be focused every day. It brings me benefits and it's my strength for me, my family, as well as for my work – for literally everything."[352] In October 2023, Benzema expressed solidarity with the victims of Israeli airstrikes in Gaza.[353]
Benzema has been dating American model Jordan Ozuna since 2022, and confirmed their relationship on Instagram.[354] Ozuna is the mother of Benzema's fourth child. In 2023, Ozuna converted to Islam.[355][356]
Since evolving internationally, Benzema has participated in numerous advertising campaigns. He was chosen as an ambassador of the American video game publisher Electronic Arts for the FIFA series. He has signed several sponsorship contracts, notably with the Korean automobile manufacturer Hyundai, the French telephone operator SFR and its subsidiary BuzzMobile, the French bank LCL and the sports betting company bwin. Benzema is sponsored by Adidas.[357] In 2017, his documentary film Le K Benzema was released.[358] In 2020, Benzema started his own YouTube channel, uploading videos of his everyday life, as well as interviews and fan Q&As.[359][360] In 2022, Benzema was named official ambassador of the Fendi Faster sneaker line.[361]

Controversies and legal issues
On 6 December 2006, he told RMC about his possible selection for the Algerian team: "It's my parents' country, it's in my heart. But well, from a sporting perspective, it's true I'll play in the French team. I'll always be available for the French team [...] It's more for the sporting side, because Algeria is my country, you see, my parents come from there. France, on the other hand ... it's more of a sport thing, that's it."[362] Benzema drew some criticism for these comments, as well as for his reluctance to sing the French national anthem, "La Marseillaise", before each match with the national team.[363][364]
On 18 April 2010, French television channel M6 reported that four members of the French national team were being investigated for their roles as clients in a prostitute ring operated inside of a Paris nightclub, with some of the women possibly being underage. The players were eventually revealed to be Franck Ribéry, Sidney Govou, Hatem Ben Arfa and Benzema.[365][366] Benzema was alleged to have had a sexual rendezvous with a prostitute when she was 16 years of age, an act Benzema denied through his lawyer.[367] On 20 July, Benzema was questioned by Paris police and indicted on the charge of "solicitation of a minor prostitute".[368][369] In November 2011, prosecutors asked for the cases against Ribéry and Benzema to be dropped, saying that the players were not aware that the escort, identified as Zahia Dehar, was 16 years old.[370] However, the case did go on to trial. In January 2014, the judge in the case dropped the charges against both Ribery and Benzema saying there was lack of sufficient evidence that the pair knew the prostitutes were underaged.[371]
On 4 November 2015, Benzema was arrested by French police for his alleged part in blackmailing fellow France international player Mathieu Valbuena over the alleged recording of a sex-tape on a mobile phone.[372] During the investigation over the blackmail plot, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls stated, "A great athlete should be exemplary. If he is not, he has no place in the France team. There are so many kids, so many youngsters in our suburbs that relate to great athletes. They wear the blue jersey, the colours of France, which are so important in these moments."[373][374] On 10 December 2015, the president of the FFF Noël Le Graët announced the provisional suspension of the striker from the French team until a new development in the affair.[375] On 17 February 2016, the judicial review was lifted by the investigating judge who allowed Benzema to get in touch again with Valbuena. On 11 July 2017, the Court of Cassation issued a judgment in which it invalidated a decision of the Court of Appeal of Versailles, which had validated the procedure by which Benzema had been indicted for complicity of attempted blackmail. This decision was made on the basis of contesting the legality of the phone calls recording by the police, and the judgement did not disprove the veracity of the blackmail attempt on Valbuena by Benzema.[376] On 7 January 2021, the public prosecutor's office in Versailles announced that Benzema would face trial for his alleged involvement in the blackmail attempt.[377] On 24 November 2021, Benzema was found guilty of conspiring to blackmail Valbuena with a sex tape.[378][379] The judge gave him a one-year suspended sentence and fined him €75,000.[378][379] His lawyers said they will appeal his conviction.[378] He was sentenced in this case in June 2022 to a one-year suspended sentence and a fine of £63,000, after having abandoned the appeal procedure. Benzema's lawyer indicated their intention to appeal the verdict.[380][381]
In March 2020, during an Instagram livestream with YouTuber and internet personality Mohamed Henni,[382] Benzema made controversial remarks about French player Olivier Giroud, who replaced Benzema in the France national team.[383] He called Giroud "karting" while he referred to himself as "Formula 1".[384] On 10 March 2023, France head coach Didier Deschamps stated in an interview with Le Parisien that he had told Benzema following his injury prior to the 2022 FIFA World Cup that there was "no emergency" and that he could "organize his return" from injury with the team manager. Deschamps then claimed that Benzema made the decision to leave the France team himself, saying "when I woke up, I learned that he had left". However, Benzema responded on his Instagram story by reposting the Deschamps statement in the interview with the caption "but what audacity". He posted a further story of French Snapchat personality Ritchie repeating the phrase "liar, you are a liar".[385]

Luis Alberto Suárez Díaz (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈlwis ˈswaɾes]; born 24 January 1987) is a Uruguayan professional footballer who plays as a striker for Major League Soccer club Inter Miami and the Uruguay national team. Nicknamed "El Pistolero" ("The Gunman"), he is regarded as one of the best players of his generation and one of the greatest strikers of all time.[2] Individually, he has won two European Golden Shoes, an Eredivisie Golden Boot, a Premier League Golden Boot and a Pichichi Trophy. He has also scored over 500 career goals for club and country.[3]
Suárez began his senior club career at Nacional in 2005. At age 19, he signed for Groningen, before transferring to Ajax in 2007. There, he won the KNVB Cup and the Eredivisie. In 2011, Suárez signed for Premier League club Liverpool, and won the League Cup in his first full season. Having established a strike partnership with Daniel Sturridge, he equalled the goalscoring record for a 38-game Premier League season and won his first European Golden Shoe in 2014. That summer, Suárez moved to Barcelona in a transfer worth £64.98 million (€82.3 million adjusted for inflation), making him one of the most expensive players of all time.
Dubbed MSN, Suárez was part of a dominant trio alongside Lionel Messi and Neymar, winning the treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League in his first season. In his second season, he won the Pichichi Trophy and his second European Golden Shoe, becoming the first player since 2009 to win both awards other than Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo.[4] He also led La Liga in assists, becoming the first player to do so in both goals and assists in league history.[5][6] With Barcelona, Suárez won ten additional trophies, including three La Liga titles and three Copas del Rey. He signed for Atlético Madrid in 2020, winning his fifth La Liga title in his second season.[7]
At international level, Suárez is Uruguay's all-time leading goalscorer, and formerly held the title of highest scorer in CONMEBOL FIFA World Cup qualifiers before being surpassed by teammate Lionel Messi.[8] He has represented his nation at four editions of the FIFA World Cup and four editions of the Copa América, as well as the 2012 Summer Olympics and the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup. He was named in the 2010 World Cup All-Star Team and won the 2011 Copa América, where he was awarded Best Player. Outside of his football credentials, Suárez has been a source of controversy throughout his career,[9][10][11] including a goal-line handball against Ghana at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, biting opponents on three occasions,[12][13][14][15] accusations of diving,[16][17] and racial incidents.


Club career
Youth
Suárez lived his early years at the Cerro neighbourhood in Salto, where he played youth football at Sportivo Artigas.[18] At age seven, he moved with his family (parents and six brothers) to Montevideo, where he played youth football at Urreta.[19] When he was a child, a car ran over his foot, breaking the fifth metatarsal bone. In spite of the injury, he continued to play.[20]

Suárez joined local side Nac's youth team at age 14.[21] At age 16, Suárez headbutted a referee after showing his discontent following a red card, although a sports editor claimed he "accidentally fell into the referee".[22] One night, he was caught drinking and partying, prompting his coach to threaten he would never play unless he started playing football more seriously.[21] In May 2005, at age 18, Suárez made his first-team debut against Atlético Junior in the Copa Libertadores.[21] He scored his first goal in September 2005[23] and helped Nacional win the 2005–06 Uruguayan league with 10 goals in 27 matches.[24]
Suárez was found by a group of scouts from the Dutch club Groningen when they were in Uruguay to scout another player. As they watched, he won and converted a penalty and scored a "wonder goal" against Defensor. After watching only that match, the scouts approached Suárez and said they wanted to buy him, and after the season, Groningen paid Nacional €800,000 for him.[21] Suárez was thrilled to go to Europe because his then girlfriend, and now wife, Sofía Balbi, had moved to Barcelona; they had maintained a long-distance relationship for a year and he wanted to move closer to her.[22][23]

Groningen
Suárez on the training field of Groningen in 2006
Suárez was 19 years old when he joined Groningen. Initially, Suárez struggled because he could not speak Dutch or English, and he played on the second team to adjust to the Dutch game.[25] His teammate and fellow Uruguayan, Bruno Silva, and his teammate Rùfson, helped him settle into living in the Netherlands and playing for a new team.[25] He worked hard to learn Dutch and his teammates respected him for his efforts with the language.[25] Suárez scored goals for Groningen, but he also had disciplinary problems; in one five-game stretch in January 2007, he scored four goals but received three yellow cards and one red card.[26] Suárez especially made his mark in a 4–3 home win over Vitesse, when with ten minutes to go he subsequently won a penalty and scored two goals.[27] Suárez ended with 10 goals in 29 league appearances[28] to help Groningen finish eighth in the 2006–07 Eredivisie.[25] He also scored in a 4–2 loss to Serbian club Partizan in his European debut on 14 September 2006.[25][29]
Ajax saw potential in Suárez and offered Groningen €3.5 million for him, but Groningen rejected the offer.[30] Suárez was upset and brought his case to the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB)'s arbitration committee to try to facilitate the sale.[30] The arbitration committee ruled against him on 9 August 2007, but that same day, Ajax increased their offer to €7.5 million and Groningen accepted.[31][32]

During the 2008–09 season, Ajax head coach Marco van Basten noted how Suárez played an important role in many of Ajax's goals, but Van Basten was also upset by the number of yellow cards Suárez received.[34] Suárez was suspended for one match[38] because he was given his seventh yellow card of the season against Utrecht in a 2–0 win.[39] He was also suspended after a half-time altercation with teammate Albert Luque over a free kick.[26][34] Ajax ended the season in third place.[40] Suárez scored 22 goals in 31 league matches[34][37] and finished second in scoring tables, one goal behind Mounir El Hamdaoui of AZ.[41] Suárez was also named Ajax Player of the Year.[42]

Soon after Suárez returned from his World Cup campaign, he scored his 100th goal for Ajax in a 1–1 home draw against PAOK in a UEFA Champions League qualifier.[42][54] This put him in an elite group of players, including Johan Cruyff, Marco van Basten and Dennis Bergkamp, to score 100 or more goals with the club.[55][54] Suárez continued his scoring run with a hat-trick against De Graafschap in a 5–0 win.[56]
On 20 November 2010, Suárez bit PSV's Otman Bakkal on the shoulder during a 0–0 draw. Ajax suspended him for two matches and fined him an undisclosed amount, which the club said they would donate to a "good cause".[57] The Dutch daily newspaper De Telegraaf branded Suárez the "Cannibal of Ajax".[12][55] The KNVB increased Suárez's suspension to seven league matches.[58] Suárez apologized for his actions through a video he uploaded to his Facebook page.[55]

Liverpool
Transfer
During the suspension, Ajax were in contact with other European clubs interested in Suárez. On 28 January 2011, they accepted a €26.5 million (£22.8 million) offer for Suárez from Premier League club Liverpool.[59][60][61] Despite leaving while suspended, Suárez departed Ajax on good terms, and he was given a farewell sendoff after an Ajax match. During the sendoff, an Ajax coach spoke to him and the crowd and said how the club wished he could stay longer; the crowd applauded their agreement and fireworks followed.[62] Ajax ended the 2010–11 season as Eredivisie champions[63] and Suárez was given a winner's medal[24][64] for his 7 goals in 13 appearances.[65]
On 31 January 2011, Suárez signed a five-and-a-half-year deal with Liverpool until 2016,[59][66] and was the club's most expensive signing (£22.8 million) until the arrival of Andy Carroll (£35 million) a few hours later.[67] Suárez requested the number seven shirt, which had been worn by Liverpool legends Kenny Dalglish, his new manager, Kevin Keegan, and Peter Beardsley[68]

Suárez made his Liverpool debut on 2 February against Stoke City at Anfield in a 2–0 win; he came on as a substitute and scored Liverpool's second goal in front of the Kop in the 79th minute.[67][69] He was one of Liverpool's best players during his partial season[70][71] and helped Liverpool go from 12th in the league in mid-January[70] to finish sixth.[72] He finished the 2010–11 season with four goals in 13 games.[65]
After winning the Player of the Tournament at the 2011 Copa América,[73] Suárez had a disappointing 2011–12 season by his standards.[74] Liverpool finished in eighth place and Suárez scored 11 league goals.[74] On 26 February, Liverpool won the League Cup, defeating Cardiff City in a penalty shootout.[75] On 28 April, Suárez scored his first Liverpool hat-trick in a 3–0 win against Norwich City at Carrow Road.[76] He finished sixth for the 2011 FIFA Ballon d'Or.[77]

Racial abuse incident
The season was marked by an incident in which Suárez was found guilty by a three-man panel from The Football Association (FA) of racially abusing Patrice Evra during a match against Manchester United in October; he was issued an eight-match suspension and a £40,000 fine.[78] Suárez disputed this decision.[79]
After a 1–1 draw against Manchester United on 15 October 2011, Suárez was accused of racially abusing Evra,[80] and the FA opened up an investigation into the incident.[80] Suárez wrote on his Twitter and Facebook pages that he was upset by the accusation and denied the claims.[81] On 16 November, the FA announced it would charge Suárez with "abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour contrary to FA rules", including "a reference to the ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race of Patrice Evra". Liverpool later released a statement announcing Suárez would plead innocent, adding they would "remain fully supportive" of him.[82] On 20 December, the FA concluded a seven-day hearing, handing Suárez an eight-match ban and a £40,000 fine for racially abusing Evra.[78][83][84]
In their next meeting in February, during the pregame handshakes, Suárez avoided shaking Evra's hand, for which Suárez and Dalglish were later forced to apologise.[85] Suárez was also banned for one match for making an obscene gesture towards Fulham fans.[86]

2012–13: Return and individual success
On 7 August 2012, Suárez signed a new long-term contract with Liverpool.[87] On 26 August, he scored his first goal of the 2012–13 season in a 2–2 draw with champions Manchester City at Anfield.[88] On 29 September 2012, Suárez scored a hat-trick in Liverpool's Premier League fixture away at Norwich City for the second consecutive season.[89]

Suárez playing for Liverpool against Arsenal in January 2013
On 6 January 2013, Suárez handled the ball before scoring the decisive goal in Liverpool's 2–1 win over Mansfield Town from the Conference National in an FA Cup third round match. Liverpool's manager Brendan Rodgers defended his player by claiming "it's not his job to own up", while Mansfield manager Paul Cox said he felt "a little bit gutted" by the "instinctive" handball, but admitted he would have accepted a goal scored like that by one of his players.[90]
On 19 January, Suárez scored his seventh goal in three matches against Norwich, as Liverpool cruised to a 5–0 home league victory.[91] The following week, Suárez captained Liverpool for the first time for the FA Cup fourth round match against Oldham Athletic; Liverpool lost 2–3.[92] On 2 March, Suárez scored a hat-trick against Wigan Athletic, leading Liverpool to a dominant 4–0 victory at the DW Stadium. In so doing, he became only the third Liverpool player to score 20 Premier League goals in a single season after Robbie Fowler and Fernando Torres.[93] On 10 March, Suárez scored his 50th goal in all competitions since joining the Reds by scoring the opener in a 3–2 home victory over Tottenham Hotspur, ending Spurs' 12-match unbeaten run. He was also named man of the match for his performance after he won the decisive penalty which Steven Gerrard converted.
At the end of the season, Suárez was one of six players named on the shortlist for PFA Players' Player of the Year.[94] Suárez finished second in the final ballot behind Gareth Bale of Tottenham[95] and was named in the PFA Team of the Year.[95] He was second-top goalscorer in the Premier League for 2012–13 with 23 goals and Liverpool's top scorer in all competitions with 30 goals.[96] On 28 May 2013, he was named as Liverpool's player of the season after receiving 64% of votes in a poll of the club's supporters.[97]

Second biting incident
On 21 April 2013, during a 2–2 draw with Chelsea in a Premier League match at Anfield, Suárez bit Branislav Ivanović; this was the second time Suárez had bitten an opponent.[98] It was not noticed by the officials, and Suárez scored an equalizer in injury time.[13] The bite prompted UK Prime Minister David Cameron to call on the FA to take a hard line with Suárez: the FA charged him with violent conduct and he was fined an undisclosed sum by his club.[99] Contrary to claims from Suárez, Ivanović did not accept an apology.[99] Suárez accepted the violent conduct charge but denied the FA's claim the standard punishment of three matches was clearly insufficient for his offence.[100] A three-man independent panel appointed by the FA decided on a ten-game ban for Suárez, who did not appeal the ban; the panel criticized Suárez for not appreciating "the seriousness" of the incident when he argued against a long ban. The panel also wanted to send a "strong message that such deplorable behaviours do not have a place in football", while noting that "all players in the higher level of the game are seen as role models, have the duty to act professionally and responsibly, and set the highest example of good conduct to the rest of the game – especially to young players".[101]
On 31 May 2013, Suárez said he would be seeking an exit from Liverpool in the summer, citing excessive media attention on his family as a reason for wanting to leave.[102] On 6 August, after Liverpool had rejected a bid of £40,000,001 for the player from Arsenal, Suárez reiterated his wish to leave Liverpool and said Liverpool had previously promised to allow him a transfer if the club failed to qualify for the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League.[103] The following day, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers said Liverpool had not broken any promises to Suárez and that the player had shown "total disrespect" for the club.[104] After this incident, the British press reported that Suárez had been instructed to train away from the Liverpool first-team squad by Rodgers.[104][105][106] On 8 August, Liverpool owner John W. Henry stated that Suárez would not be allowed to leave the club.[107]

On 1 January 2014, by scoring in a 2–0 home win over Hull City, Suárez became the first Liverpool player to score 20 or more goals in successive Premier League seasons since Robbie Fowler in 1994–95 and 1995–96.[122] He equaled Andy Cole's Premier League record for the earliest date to reach the 20-goal mark, but set a new record low of 15 matches.[123] His strike partnership this season with Daniel Sturridge has earned them a nickname "SAS", i.e., Sturridge and Suárez.[124]
On 1 March, Suárez made his 100th Premier League appearance, scoring in a 3–0 win over Southampton at St Mary's Stadium.[125] In the following fixture, he scored his 25th league goal of the season as Liverpool defeated Manchester United at Old Trafford for the first time since 2009 by a convincing three-goal margin.[126] On 22 March, Suárez scored his sixth Premier League hat-trick, and third of the season, in a 6–3 win over Cardiff City at the Cardiff City Stadium.[127] On 30 March, he broke Robbie Fowler's club record of 28 goals in a Premier League season in a 4–0 home win against Tottenham which took Liverpool top of the league with six matches remaining.[128] On 20 April, he scored in a 3–2 win at Norwich to become the first Liverpool player to score 30 league goals in a season since Ian Rush in 1986–87.[129] This also made him the seventh player to score 30 goals in a Premier League season, following Andy Cole, Alan Shearer, Kevin Phillips, Thierry Henry, Cristiano Ronaldo and Robin van Persie.[130]

Suarez has the possibility of being fitted with a prosthesis."[261] However, on the next day, Grêmio played against América Mineiro, resulting in a 3–1 victory with a decisive performance by Suárez; with one goal, one assist and multiple plays and goal attempts. In the post-match press interview, Grêmio's vice-president Paulo Caleffi denied any rumors and Suárez himself mocked the rumors in social media.[262]
In July, rumours resurfaced that Suárez still had knee issues and wished to leave early, starting negotiations with Grêmio's board.[263][264] After various rumours on media, Suárez revealed on a press conference together with Grêmio's vice-president Antônio Brum that he would shorten his contract to the end of 2023.

He did play in the tournament finals, and he scored two goals in four appearances.[279] His goals came in a group stage draw against Spain[280] and in the Round of 16 against the United States, but the U.S. won 2–1 and Uruguay was eliminated from the tournament.[281]

In June 2010, Óscar Tabárez named Suárez to Uruguay's 23-man World Cup squad.[282] Uruguay began the tournament with a 0–0 draw against France.[283] In the second match, a 3–0 win over South Africa, Suárez drew a penalty and assisted Álvaro Pereira's stoppage time goal.[284] In the final match of the group stage, he headed in a goal off a pass from Edinson Cavani and was named Man of the Match in a 1–0 win over Mexico.[285][286] Uruguay won Group A and advanced to the knockout stage.[285][286]
During the round of 16 against South Korea, Suárez scored both goals in a 2–1 win.

Asamoah Gyan hit the crossbar with the ensuing penalty kick[289] and Suárez, who had stopped to watch, celebrated the miss before heading down the tunnel.[292][293] Uruguay won the shootout 4–2 and advanced to the semi-finals.[289][294]
After the match, Suárez said, "I made the save of the tournament."[291] He said he had no alternative, was acting out of instinct, and would do it again if it helped his team win.[295] Ghana head coach Milovan Rajevac said the play was an "injustice"[292] and Suárez was labelled a villain and a cheater.[296][295] Others viewed him as a hero.[55][297] Due to the automatic suspension that accompanies a red card, Suárez sacrificed himself in the semi-final for the unlikely chance the penalty would be missed, and his team would later win.[26][296]
While Suárez was suspended for the semi-final match for his red card against Ghana,[298] Uruguay "lacked a second striker [alongside Diego Forlán] of cunning and movement"[299] and lost 3–2 to the Netherlands.[300][301] Suárez returned for the third place game against Germany; he was booed almost every time he had the ball because of his handball in the Ghana match.[302] He assisted Cavani on Uruguay's first goal,[303] but Uruguay lost 3–2.[302] During the tournament, Suárez played 543 minutes in six appearances and scored three goals.[304]

Suárez (middle) celebrating one of his two goals against England at the 2014 World Cup
Suárez ended the 2014 World Cup qualification campaign as top scorer in the South American section with 11 goals in 14 matches.[321] In November 2013, Uruguay defeated Jordan 5–0 on aggregate in an intercontinental play-off to qualify for the 2014 World Cup.[322]
On 22 May, Suárez underwent emergency surgery on his left knee. He was confined to a wheelchair for a time, leading to rumours he would be unable to participate in the World Cup.[323][324][325] He was named as a substitute for Uruguay's first match, a 3–1 defeat to Costa Rica, but did not play in the match. Suárez started Uruguay's second match against England and scored both of the team's goals in a 2–1 win at the Arena Corinthians in São Paulo.[326]
For Uruguay's final group match against Italy on 24 June, Uruguay needed a win to advance to the knockout stage while Italy only needed a draw.[327] Around the 79th minute and with the score at 0–0, Suárez clashed with Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini while waiting for a cross. Replays showed that Suárez lunged at Chiellini and bit his shoulder (Chiellini showed bite marks), followed by Suárez falling and clutching his face.[14][328] The controversial incident made headline news around the world.[329] As the Italian players protested to Mexican referee Marco Antonio Rodríguez for not penalizing Suárez for the bite, Uruguay won a corner and scored. The match would finish 1–0 to Uruguay as they qualified for the knockout stage and eliminated Italy.[14][328][330]
Two days later, on 26 June, the FIFA Disciplinary Committee, banned Suárez for nine international matches, effective immediately, meaning he would take no further part in the World Cup. The ban ruled him out of 2015 Copa América as well. It was the longest such ban in World Cup history, exceeding the eight-match ban handed to Italy's Mauro Tassotti for breaking the nose of Spain's Luis Enrique at the 1994 World Cup.[141][331] He was also banned from taking part in any football-related activity (including entering any stadium) for four months and fined CHF100,000.[141][331] The seven-member FIFA panel studied the incident from 34 camera angles and rejected Suárez's defense that the bite was as a result of an accidental collision, instead finding the bite was "deliberate, intentional and without provocation... with the intention of wounding [Chiellini] or at least of destabilizing him". The severity of the penalty was due to the fact it was Suárez's third biting offence, as well as what FIFA saw as a lack of remorse.[332] Soon after the suspension was announced, online gambling firm 888poker cancelled its sponsorship deal with Suárez.[333] With Suárez banned, Uruguay lost their next match 0–2 to Colombia and were eliminated from the World Cup.[334]
On the same day the ban was announced, the Uruguayan Football Association (AUF) said it would appeal the suspension.[335] Suárez's lawyer said that "we don't have any doubts" of a European-based campaign against Suárez.[336] Various Uruguayan individuals defended Suárez, questioning if he had actually bitten Chiellini, and criticized the severity of his ban, including President of Uruguay José Mujica, who labelled the ban "fascist" and called FIFA "a bunch of old sons of bitches";[337][338] AUF president Wilmar Valdez;[335] Uruguay captain Diego Lugano;[339] and Uruguay head coach Óscar Tabárez, who resigned from two FIFA posts in protest of the ban.[340] The Uruguayan media were also noted to have been in a defiant and defensive mood.[341] For non-Uruguayan parties, Chiellini, who was bitten, called the ban "excessive", while international players' union FIFPro called for Suárez to "receive all the support he needs" and that the "focus should be on the rehabilitation and serious treatment" of Suárez.[340]
Six days after the incident, on 30 June, Suárez apologized to Chiellini through Twitter and vowed never to repeat the incident, while writing that the "physical result of a bite" occurred in a collision with Chiellini.[342][343] Chiellini responded through Twitter indicating all was forgotten and his hope that FIFA would reduce Suárez's suspension.[343][344]
On 3 July, the AUF appealed Suárez's ban,[345] but it was rejected by FIFA on 10 July.[346][347] With Suárez's ban not preventing him from transferring to another club,[348] it was announced on 11 July that Suárez had agreed to move to Barcelona.[349][350][351] Days before the transfer, Suárez's apology to Chiellini had been praised by various Barcelona club individuals. Barcelona club president Josep Maria Bartomeu said the apology was "honorable", sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta welcomed Suárez as being "humble enough to admit an error" while new signing Ivan Rakitić commended Suárez's "character and strength".[352][353]

In the quarter-finals against Peru on 29 June, he had a goal disallowed by VAR for offside, and was subsequently the only player to miss his spot-kick in the resulting penalty shoot-out, following a 0–0 draw after regulation time, which saw Uruguay eliminated from the competition.[366]
On 8 October 2020, Suárez scored the first goal of the South American 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification, becoming the first player ever to score the opening goal three times (after his 2010 and 2014 strikes) in the competition's history.[367]

2021–present: Copa América and 2022 World Cup
On 22 June 2021, Suárez scored in a 1–1 draw against Chile in Uruguay's second group match of the 2021 Copa América in Brazil.[368] However, Uruguay lost against Colombia in the quarter-finals on penalties after a goalless draw.[369]
On 2 December 2022, in Uruguay's final group match of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar against Ghana, Suárez assisted Giorgian de Arrascaeta's second goal of the match to give Uruguay a 2–0 win; however, group rivals South Korea scored a late goal to win 2–1 against already-qualified Portugal, advancing from the group stage instead of Uruguay having scored four goals to Uruguay's two (both teams were tied at 4 points and a 0 goal difference).[370]

Style of play
Suárez in action for Liverpool takes on Sylvain Distin of Everton during the Merseyside Derby in 2012
Suárez creates goal scoring chances with his powerful shot, and has "remarkable technical ability" according to his FIFA profile.[371] Known for his direct running at players, Suárez has a particular penchant for nutmegging opponents (putting the ball through their legs).[372] Liverpool fans (accompanied with a banner) used to say he was so good, "he could nutmeg a mermaid".[373] Often regarded by many as one of the best strikers of all time,[374][375][376][377][378][379][380] Suárez is a prolific goal scorer, having the rare distinction of being the leading scorer in three top-flight European leagues, a feat only matched by Ruud van Nistelrooy[381] and Cristiano Ronaldo.[382] An accurate finisher[383] with either foot,[384] despite being naturally right-footed,[385] he is capable of scoring from both inside[386] and outside the penalty area.[387]
Harry Redknapp said that Suárez could play anywhere – as the target man or behind as a second striker. Uruguay head coach Óscar Tabárez called Suárez "a great forward, an elite player among forwards in the world",[388] and Liverpool coach Kenny Dalglish said, "he's intelligent, he's had a fantastic education at Ajax".[389] Former Liverpool striker John Aldridge said his abilities allow him to get into a position to score and evade defenders.[390][391] Meanwhile, Thierry Henry called Suárez the best striker in the world, stating, "He has everything. He's in your face, he's arrogant- in a good way, he can volley it, he can score headers. He has vicious side to his game and I will not call it cheating. He knows how to score goals."[392]
Suárez has been praised for his work rate,[390] movement,[393] and his quickness[389] that allows him to attack from the outside;[371] as such he occasionally played as an inverted winger on the left flank during his time with Ajax.[394] Additionally, Suárez has a liking for often executing dummies (going around the defenders with a fake-out) within his style of dribbling.[395] During his time in Barcelona, he was known for constantly scoring through volleys or half-volleys.[396][397] Suárez also gained a reputation for consistently scoring acrobatic goals, often shooting off balance, or in air, or with overhead bicycle kicks.[398][399][400] Moreover, he is an accurate free kick taker,[401] and has also been known to take penalties.[402]
He also creates many scoring opportunities for his teammates with his vision and great passing abilities, as is reflected in his numbers of assists, among the very highest within the stat's recorded history.[403] Former Liverpool captain, Steven Gerrard, lauded Suárez's unselfish playstyle within his autobiography, stating how that "It's a rare combination, to be a miraculous footballer who is willing to use his gifts to selflessly assist and create goals for a teammate", as well as further writing, "He scores goals. He creates goals. He's hard and horrible to play against. You've got a chance of beating anyone in the world with Luis Suárez in your team".[404][405]
In addition to being a prolific player, Suárez has often been praised for his strong mentality and desire to win. Former Liverpool teammate, Jordan Henderson dubbed Suárez as a "warrior", claiming that his attitude inspired confidence among his teammates.[406] Meanwhile, Gerrard eulogized his drive to succeed, stating "Luis played to win a five-a-side training session like he was chasing the Champions League or the World Cup. If his team lost a kickaround he went home angry; he always needed to win that badly".[405] Atletico Madrid coach, Diego Simeone hailed Suárez for the "desire and energy" he brought to the club.[407] Suárez, himself, has stated that he's the kind of player who would "kill himself just to prevent a throw-in at the 90th minute." in his autobiography.[408]
Former Ajax coach Marco van Basten criticized Suárez for his tendency to receive yellow cards.[34] Van Basten said he had a tense relationship with Suárez,[34] although he conceded that "Luis is unpredictable, he's hard to influence but that makes him special."[34] At times, Suárez can be dominant but fail to convert his efforts into goals.[409] Despite his weaknesses, Suárez's leadership stood out to Ajax management.[59]

Controversies
Suárez has been widely accused of diving.[16][410][411][412] His manager, teammates and various analysts have commented that this reputation for simulation has caused referees not to award him legitimate penalties.[413][414] In January 2013, Suárez admitted to diving against Stoke City in an October 2012 match. This led his manager Brendan Rodgers to comment his actions were "unacceptable" and that he would be dealt with "internally" by the club.[415] During the 2018 World Cup game against Portugal, after collisions with Portuguese players, Suarez twice acted like he had a head injury despite his head having been untouched.[416]
Suárez is infamous for biting opponents on multiple occasions. In a Group D matchup at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Suarez was shown to have bitten Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini, resulting in FIFA suspending Suarez from all football activities for 4 months. While playing for Liverpool, Suarez bit Chelsea player Branislav Ivanović in a Premier League match, and was punished with a ten match ban. In an earlier incident while playing for AFC Ajax he was caught biting PSV Eindhoven player Otman Bakkal and was suspended for seven games.[98] Suárez has also been accused of stamping on opponents in the Premier League and the UEFA Europa League.[417][418][419][420]
Due to his diving, biting, stamping, and other antics, Suárez has been frequently labelled as a pest and a cheat.[421] In December 2013, Spanish football website El Gol Digital ranked Suárez at fifth in its list of the world's dirtiest footballers.[422]

Media and sponsorship
Previously with Adidas, Suárez has been sponsored by Puma since 2018. He wears Puma Future 2.1.
Suárez had a sponsorship deal with German sportswear and equipment supplier Adidas, before switching to rivals Puma in 2018.[423] Suárez starred in a 2014 advert for Beats with other global football stars including Neymar and Thierry Henry, with the theme of "The Game Before the Game" and the players' pre-game ritual of listening to music.[424] In Uruguay, Suárez has also appeared in advertisements for Abitab, Antel, Cablevisión, Garnier, Pepsi and Samsung.[425][426]
Suárez features in EA Sports' FIFA video game series: as a result of Suárez's ban for his bite on Giorgio Chiellini at the 2014 World Cup, players in FIFA 15 were unable to select Suárez until his ban ended on 26 October.[427]
Active on social media, Suárez has over 40 million Instagram followers as of May 2020, the most for a person from Uruguay.[428][429]

Personal life
Suárez was born in Salto, Uruguay to Sandra Diaz and Rodolfo Suárez, the fourth of seven boys.[26][430] His older brother, Paolo Suárez, is a retired professional footballer, who last played for Isidro Metapán in El Salvador.
Suárez moved with his family to Montevideo when he was seven, and his parents separated when he was nine.[430] In Montevideo, he developed his football skills on the streets,[23][430] while also taking up work as a street sweeper at the age of 15.[22] In 1998, aged 11 he appeared as a contestant on children's game show Aventujuegos, with his team winning: his episode was brought up in a 2011 episode of chat show Noche de Locura and he was surprised the footage had been kept.[3]
The contrast between his life in Europe and the poverty he left behind has been cited as contributing to his periodic aggression on the field, as well as being a possible explanation for the more forgiving attitudes of the Uruguayan public and press towards such cases, compared to Europe.[22] Besides his native tongue, Suárez is able to speak Dutch and English.[431][432]

Mural of Suárez on his former school in Montevideo, Uruguay
Suárez is of mixed race and has a black grandfather.[433] The matter of ethnicity was raised in reporting on the Patrice Evra incident, where use by his grandmother, Lila Piriz, of "mi negrito" as a sobriquet has been offered to explain Suárez's repeated use of "negro" over the two-minute altercation; the FA judged his evidence unreliable, issuing him an eight-match ban. His mother also supported the claim Suárez made that using the word was not racist in Uruguay. She said it was "normal", and that it was "a word people use with their friends. It's like calling someone fat, thin or whatever."[434]
Suárez began dating Sofía Balbi at age 15 in Montevideo; the Balbi family moved to Barcelona in 2003, and Suárez's focus on football strengthened as a result as he wanted to follow them to Europe to join Sofía again.[22] Suárez married her in 2009, and the couple have a daughter (born 2010) and two sons (born 2013 and 2018).[435][26][436] He has a tattoo of his daughter's name Delfina on his wrist which he kisses as part of his goal celebration – this celebration routine is featured in EA Sports' video game FIFA 15 as "Kiss The Wrist".[437][438] In 2014, Suárez joined Barcelona, allowing him to live closer to Sofía's family. On the move, Suárez said, "[Liverpool] did all they could to get me to stay, but playing and living in Spain, where my wife's family live, is a lifelong dream and ambition. I believe now the timing is right."[439] In 2014, Suárez released his autobiography, Crossing the Line – My Story.[440][441]
Suárez, who is married to an Italian citizen, was eligible to take a B1 Italian Language exam and flew to Perugia in September 2020 to take the test and gain Italian citizenship. Though obtaining the results of the language exam and approval of citizenship takes several months and several years respectively to be processed, Suárez reportedly got his language exam results within hours and would have his citizenship approved in several weeks. The Italian media had noted that this led to accusations of special treatment against Suárez, especially as Italian laws had been changed in 2018 to make obtaining citizenship by marriage more difficult.[442] In September 2020, an investigation was launched over accusations that he had cheated his way into gaining Italian citizenship.[229]
It is known that Suárez has used his experience and knowledge to mentor new Uruguayan footballing talents, most notably Darwin Núñez.[443]
Suárez is a devout Catholic.[444]

Andrés Iniesta Luján (Spanish pronunciation: [anˈdɾes iˈnjesta luˈxan]; born 11 May 1984) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for UAE Pro League club Emirates. Widely considered one of the greatest midfielders of all time,[4][5][6] he was lauded for his balance, ball control and agility in close spaces, combined with his skill, composure, and flair on the ball. Iniesta has spent most of his career at Barcelona, where he played a major role in the club's success along with his midfield partners Xavi and Sergio Busquets.
Iniesta started his professional career through La Masia, the Barcelona youth academy, after an early migration from his birthplace, and impressed from an early age. He made his first-team debut aged 18 in 2002. He began playing regularly during the 2004–05 season and remained in the team until 2018. Iniesta was an integral part of the Barcelona sides that won two historic trebles in 2009 and 2015, and his 35 trophies, which includes nine La Ligas and four UEFA Champions League titles, make him the most decorated Spanish footballer of all time.[7] After 22 years at Barcelona, Iniesta signed for J1 League club Vissel Kobe in 2018. After leaving the club in 2023, Iniesta signed for UAE Pro League club Emirates.
Iniesta played for Spain at the Under-16, Under-19 and Under-21 levels before making his international debut in 2006. He helped Spain win UEFA Euro 2008, playing every game and being selected in the Team of the Tournament. Iniesta was also a key member of the victorious Spanish team at the 2010 FIFA World Cup; he scored the winning goal in the final against the Netherlands, for which he was named the Man of the Match, and was selected to the tournament's All-Star Team. His performances in 2010 for both club and country saw him being runner-up to Lionel Messi for the 2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or. At UEFA Euro 2012, Iniesta led Spain to their second consecutive continental crown, again being chosen as the Man of the Match of the final against Italy, and was named the Player of the Tournament.
Iniesta has been named in the FIFA FIFPro World XI nine times and was chosen in the UEFA Team of the Year on six occasions. He was named in the All-time UEFA Euro XI. He won the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award in 2012 and was named the IFFHS World's Best Playmaker in 2012 and 2013. Besides his runner-up position in 2010, he also achieved third place in the 2012 Ballon d'Or.


Club career[edit]
FC Barcelona[edit]
Early career[edit]
Iniesta comes from Fuentealbilla, a small village in the province of Albacete, Castile–La Mancha, where he mostly played futsal due to the lack of football pitches in the village.[8] At the age of 12, while playing for Albacete Balompié in a junior seven-a-side tournament in Albacete, he attracted the attention of scouts from clubs around Spain.[9] His parents knew Barcelona's youth team coach, Enrique Orizaola, and he persuaded them to consider sending Iniesta to the Barcelona youth academy. Iniesta traveled there with his parents and visited La Masia, the farmhouse where the club houses its young players; the trip convinced them to enroll Iniesta in the Barcelona youth ranks.[10]

—Iniesta on La Masia education of ball retention, passing and using space[11]

Iniesta says he "cried rivers" the day he left for La Masia and struggled being separated from his parents;[12] he was very shy and kept to himself while there.[13] He captained the Barcelona Under-15 team to victory in the Nike Premier Cup of 1999, scoring the winning goal in the last minute of the final, and was named player of the tournament. Just after Iniesta arrived at the club, then-captain Pep Guardiola famously told fellow midfielder Xavi: "You're going to retire me. This lad [Iniesta] is going to retire us all."[14]

2004–2008[edit]
Iniesta with Barcelona in 2006
Iniesta joined the first team during the tenure of Radomir Antić. On 29 October 2002, he made his first team debut in a 1–0 away win against Club Brugge in the UEFA Champions League group stage. In the 2004–05 season, he featured in 37 out of 38 league games—more than any other player—although 25 of these were substitute appearances. He scored twice as Barcelona won La Liga.[15] An injury to Xavi at the start of the 2005–06 season allowed Iniesta more regular starts in the centre of midfield, and he continued to improve and develop.[16] He played in 11 UEFA Champions League games, including a half-time appearance in the 2006 final, to replace Edmílson.[17] His contribution to the team was praised by manager Frank Rijkaard as Barcelona won a league and Champions League double.[18]
The 2006–07 season saw Iniesta's profile continue to rise and he earned plaudits for his willingness to play in any position for his team. In the pre-season, he lifted the Joan Gamper Trophy as the captain of the team after a 4–0 victory over German side Bayern Munich. Iniesta played for the first time as a left wing-forward for Barça in two Champions League matches against Levski Sofia, finding the net twice. In the first knockout stage of the same competition, he played in central midfield against Liverpool. Despite being moved around the pitch by manager Rijkaard, the 2006–07 season remains Iniesta's highest scoring thus far.
With the departure of Ludovic Giuly ahead of the 2007–08 campaign, Iniesta was able to switch his number 24 shirt for his preferred number 8.[19] Despite rumours of a possible transfer before the season,[20] he extended his contract to 2014 on 25 January 2008,[21] with his buy-out clause being raised to €150 million.[22] Don Balón, a member of European Sports Magazines, named Iniesta one of the most consistent performers in the previous two seasons of La Liga; he placed fifth in 2006–07 and fourth in 2007–08.[23][24] He also placed ninth in the 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year voting, gaining 37 total points.[25]

2008–09[edit]
At the start of the 2008–09 season, in September 2008, Iniesta was elected the fourth-choice captain behind, in order of preference, Carles Puyol, Xavi and Víctor Valdés; all four were products of the Barcelona youth system.[26] His performances throughout the season were highly lauded, and he received standing ovations both in Barcelona at the Camp Nou, as well as from rival supporters in away matches.[27] A leg injury sustained in mid-November 2008 left Iniesta sidelined until 3 January; initially expected to return to action in six weeks, he did not want to come back until he was 100 percent. Upon his return to action on 3 January, as a 65th-minute substitute against Mallorca, he scored a crucial goal after just ten minutes on the pitch and completed a Barcelona comeback in front of the Camp Nou.[28] 3 days later, he captained Barcelona for the first time in an official match, a 3–1 victory against Atlético Madrid at the Vicente Calderón in the round-of-16 first leg of the Copa del Rey.
Iniesta sustained another injury during a home match against Málaga, but returned to action for the first leg Champions League quarter-final against Bayern Munich on 8 April, which Barcelona won 4–0.[29] He scored a vital equaliser in the final minute of stoppage time during the second leg of the Champions League semi-final against Chelsea, with a curling strike with the outside of his right foot 25 yards from goal, securing the tie on away goals as the match finished 1–1 at Stamford Bridge.[30] In the season review, Un Any Al Paradis, Iniesta wrote, "I connected with that shot with the outside, not the inside or the tip of my boot, but right from my heart, with all my might."[31]



"I knew I would play injured and do more damage. For 17 days, all I thought about was the final in Rome and winning, even knowing that I would do more damage. I'd repeat it, for sure. I love this club and my profession and I wanted to win. If we had lost the final that would have been a total disaster."


—Iniesta on the victorious 2009 UEFA Champions League Final[32]

Iniesta's goal against Chelsea sent Barcelona through to the final in Rome against defending champions Manchester United. Prior to the final, United manager Alex Ferguson identified Iniesta as Barça's biggest threat: "He's fantastic. He makes the team work. The way he finds passes, his movement and ability to create space is incredible. He's so important for Barcelona."[12] Despite a thigh injury, Iniesta played and was influential in the game, providing the assist for the first goal scored by Samuel Eto'o as his team went on to win 2–0.[33] In his analysis, David Pleat wrote, "In the end the midfield artistry of Iniesta and Xavi, helped by [Lionel] Messi, was the critical factor."[34] After the game, United striker Wayne Rooney described Iniesta as the best player in the world.[35]
Iniesta received plaudits for his performances that season; Don Balón rated him as the league's most consistent performer.[36] Later that year, he placed fifth for the 2009 FIFA World Player of the Year award, with 134 votes,[37] and fourth for the Ballon d'Or, receiving 149 points.[38] Barcelona extended his contract by one year, until 2015, and raised his buy-out clause to €200 million.[39]

2009–2012[edit]
Barcelona won a second successive league title in the 2009–10 season, securing a record 99 points. Individually, however, Iniesta endured a campaign largely disrupted by recurring injuries. He missed pre-season fitness training due to the thigh tear suffered in the 2009 Champions League final.[40] Despite featuring in almost as many matches as the previous season, he did so mostly as a substitute, starting only 20 games throughout.[41] His season came to a premature end in April after he aggravated a previous calf injury during training.[42]

A contributing factor of Iniesta's fractured season were the episodes of psychological instability he suffered privately following the death of his close friend Daniel Jarque, a fellow footballer, in August 2009. Even when physically fit, he was often unable to complete training sessions or exert himself. After seeking psychological help, including from psychologist Inma Puig,[43] he experienced catharsis when he scored Spain's match-winning goal in the 2010 FIFA World Cup final, which he dedicated to Jarque by revealing the message "Dani Jarque, always with us" written on his undershirt.[44] "I did it because I felt it deeply," Iniesta said at the time. "It showed that what is more important than rivalry, your team or your colours is to be human and a good person. I am delighted because it was the most important moment in my career."[45] Regarding the recurrent injuries that plagued his season, he said, "It was hard, but I will start with more desire than ever."[45]
Iniesta scored his first goal of the 2010–11 season during the opening league fixture against Racing de Santander, lobbing the ball into the net from a distance of 30 yards.[46] Throughout the campaign, he received standing ovations from opposition fans, including at El Sardinero and the Vicente Calderón Stadium, in appreciation of his World Cup-winning goal.[47] Another standing ovation came on the home pitch of Espanyol in the Derbi barceloní, with the crowd acknowledging his friendship with Daniel Jarque, Espanyol's captain at the time of his death.[48] Iniesta was one of the three finalists for the 2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or alongside Xavi and Messi, placing as runner-up behind the Argentine.[49]
Iniesta started the 2011–12 season by scoring the opening goal in the second leg of the Supercopa de España against rivals Real Madrid. Barcelona went on to win the match 3–2 and the cup 5–4 on aggregate. One of his best goals followed in October against Viktoria Plzeň in the Champions League group stage after an interchange of passes with Messi. Iniesta played a record 51 matches unbeaten in La Liga, concluding with Barcelona's 2–0 defeat of Mallorca on 24 March.[50] In the Champions League, he ended a goal drought by scoring a vital goal against Milan in the quarter-finals. From there, he went on to score in the semi-final against Chelsea to make the scoreline 2–0, but the match ended 2–2, eliminating his team 3–2 on aggregate. Towards the end of the year, on 25 November, Iniesta was named man of the match after scoring one goal and providing three assists in a 4–0 win over Levante.[51] His performances earned him third place in the voting of the 2012 FIFA Ballon d'Or.[52]

2013–2018[edit]
Iniesta lifting the 2015 UEFA Super Cup trophy
Iniesta signed a new contract with Barcelona in December 2013, keeping him at the club until 2018.[53] As vice-captain, he regularly captained Barça throughout the club's second treble-winning campaign of the 2014–15 season, and became captain after Carles Puyol's retirement and Xavi's departure. Iniesta scored three times during the team's Copa del Rey campaign,[54] and was man of the match in the 2015 UEFA Champions League Final, having assisted Ivan Rakitić's opening goal in the 3–1 defeat of Italian champions Juventus at Berlin's Olympiastadion.[55] Their European victory made Barcelona the first club in history to win the treble of domestic league, domestic cup and European Cup twice;[56] Iniesta was among the seven players to have been a part of both treble-winning teams.[56]
During the first Clásico of the 2015–16 season, on 21 November, Iniesta became only the third Barcelona player, after Diego Maradona in 1983 and Ronaldinho in 2005, to receive applause from Real Madrid fans at the Santiago Bernabéu.[57] His man-of-the-match performance included a goal and an assist, contributing to a resounding 4–0 victory.[58]
He signed a lifetime contract with Barcelona on 6 October 2017, effectively keeping him with the club for the remainder of his career.[59] He played the 650th game of his career for Barcelona against Levante on 7 January 2018, he was replaced by André Gomes after 76 minutes as the game ended 3–0 in favour of Barcelona.[60]
Despite signing a lifetime contract, on 27 April 2018, Iniesta announced he would be leaving Barcelona by the end of the season.[61] He made his 674th and final appearance for Barcelona on 20 May, in the final league match of the season, a 1–0 home victory over Real Sociedad, as Barcelona celebrated the victory of their 25th league and 30th Copa del Rey title; he came off in the 81st minute for Paco Alcácer.[62]

Vissel Kobe[edit]
Iniesta with Vissel Kobe in 2018
On 24 May 2018, Japanese club Vissel Kobe announced the signing of Iniesta on a three-year deal.[63] He made his debut on 22 July, coming on as a second-half substitute for Kazuma Watanabe in a 0–3 defeat against Shonan Bellmare.[64] On 11 August 2018, Iniesta scored his first goal in the J1 League in a 2–1 win over Jubilo Iwata.[65]
On 21 December 2019, he scored the opening goal in a 3–1 win over Shimizu S-Pulse in the semi-final of the 2019 Emperor's Cup.[66] On 1 January 2020, he won his first trophy in Japan, starting in Vissel Kobe's 2–0 victory over Kashima Antlers in the final of the 2019 Emperor's Cup.[67] A month later, he also won the 2020 Japanese Super Cup.[68] On 7 December 2020, Iniesta suffered a tear of the rectus femoris muscle during a 2–0 win in the round of 16 of the 2020 AFC Champions League against Shanghai SIPG, in which he also scored the first goal of the game.[69] He had a successful surgery in Barcelona a few days later.[70]
On 11 May 2021, Iniesta signed a contract extension with Vissel Kobe, keeping him at the club for another two seasons.[71] On 11 November 2021, he was named J.League Monthly MVP after scoring three league goals in October.[72] He was named in the 2021 J.League Best XI on 6 December 2021.[73]
On 14 May 2022, Iniesta scored a goal and guided Vissel Kobe to its first league win of the 2022 season in a 4–0 victory over Sagan Tosu.[74]
On 25 May 2023, Vissel Kobe said Iniesta would leave the club midway through the current J.League season, on 1 July.[75] Iniesta had played significantly less for the club in his final season.[76] He stated he did not want to retire as yet, and wished to play for a club where he could get regular playing time.[77][76]

Emirates[edit]
On 7 August 2023, Iniesta arrived in the United Arab Emirates to join the UAE Pro League club Emirates.[78] He signed a one-year contract with an option to extend until 2025.[79] He made his debut on 19 August 2023 against Al Wasl where he replaced Al Sanousi Al Hadi in the second half, the match ended as a 0–1 defeat as the Emirates failed to create a single shot on target.[80] On 25 August 2023, he would score his first UAE Pro League goal in injury time against Ajman in a match that ended as a 4–4 draw.[81]

International career[edit]
2001–2008[edit]
Iniesta burst on to the international scene in 2001, helping Spain win the UEFA European Under-16 Championship. After representing his country at the 2001 FIFA U-17 World Championship held in Trinidad and Tobago,[82] he was in the squad that claimed the UEFA European Under-19 Championship the following year. From then, he became a regular choice for youth coach Juan Santisteban. In 2003, he was part of the side that reached the FIFA World Youth Championship final in the United Arab Emirates, and was named in the FIFA all-star team.[83] During his spell with the Spain U21 side, Iniesta was named captain on several occasions.
Iniesta was called up to represent the senior Spain squad at the 2006 FIFA World Cup on 15 May 2006, much to the surprise of many. He won his first cap for La Furia Roja when he was brought on at half-time in a friendly against Russia on 27 May.[83] His first goal followed in a friendly against England on 7 February 2007. His long-range effort, hitting the underside of the crossbar on the way in, gave Spain the lead on 63 minutes. Iniesta played a pivotal part in Spain's qualification for UEFA Euro 2008 by scoring goals against Sweden and by assisting the strikers.

2008–2012[edit]
Iniesta playing for Spain in September 2013
Iniesta was selected in Spain's squad for UEFA Euro 2008 in Austria and Switzerland. Though a stomach ailment somewhat hampered his performances in the group stages, he still played an integral part in the midfield. He played in the first two of Spain's group stage matches and proved an important part of the team, providing a pass for David Villa's second goal against Russia. He was not rested, unlike most of Spain's regulars, for the final group game against Greece, which Spain won 2–1 thanks to a volley from Rubén de la Red and a late winner from Daniel Güiza. Iniesta returned for the quarter-final as Spain beat Italy on penalties; he was substituted before the penalty shootout itself. In the semi-final against Russia, he played the entire 90 minutes and produced a cross that Xavi converted to open the scoring in an eventual 3–0 victory;[84] he was subsequently named the Man of the Match.[85] He played the duration of the final in Spain's 1–0 win over Germany. Iniesta was named in the Team of the Tournament alongside fellow Spain midfielders Xavi, Marcos Senna and six other teammates. Iniesta did not participate in the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup in South Africa due to a thigh muscle injury; Spain was eliminated from the tournament at the semi-final stage.[86]
Iniesta was selected for Spain in the 2010 World Cup and scored the second goal in a 2–1 group stage win against Chile. He was also named man of the match.[87] For his excellent performances in helping Spain reach the final of the tournament, Iniesta was shortlisted for the Golden Ball award.[88] During the final, he scored the winning goal in the 116th minute of a 1–0 win against Netherlands.[89] He earned a yellow card for removing his jersey during his ecstatic goal celebration to reveal his message to his late friend Dani Jarque.[90][91] He won the man of the match award for his performance in the final, which gave Spain its first-ever World Cup.[92]
At UEFA Euro 2012, Iniesta was awarded the man of the match award for his performances in three different matches. He was also selected as man of the match in the final against Italy, which Spain won 4–0. In winning the award, Iniesta became the only Spanish player to win the award at least once in each of Spain's three consecutive successful tournaments.[93] Iniesta was also chosen as the UEFA Euro 2012 Player of the Tournament.[94]

2013–2018[edit]
Iniesta with Spain at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia
At the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, Iniesta was named in the Team of the Tournament and awarded the Silver Ball for the second best player in the competition, as Spain finished runner-up to host nation Brazil.[95] Iniesta started all three matches for Spain at the 2014 World Cup, winning his 100th cap in the team's final group match against Australia.[96] At the UEFA Euro 2016, he assisted the only goal of the match against Czech Republic and put in a man of the match display to give Spain a winning start in the tournament.[97] He started in all four Spain's matches and were later knocked out by Italy in the Round of 16.
In May 2018, Iniesta was named in Spain's squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.[98] He started in all three matches of the group stage, making an assist for Isco in the 2–2 draw against Morocco on 25 June 2018. He came off the bench in the 67th minute in Spain's last match at the tournament against Russia on 1 July 2018 for the round of 16. After the loss in the penalty shoot-outs, Iniesta announced his retirement from international duty.[99] He amassed 131 senior international caps for Spain and at the time of retiring was the nation's fourth-most-capped player of all time, behind only Iker Casillas, Xavi, and Sergio Ramos.[100]

Style of play and reception[edit]
Iniesta on the ball for Barcelona against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012
Like fellow La Masia graduate Cesc Fàbregas, Iniesta originally started as a defensive midfielder,[101] but his balance, ball control and agility in close spaces, allied with his skill, composure, and flair on the ball, saw him make progress as an attacking midfielder. Beyond his raw talent that was spotted at a young age by Barcelona's scouts, it was his great versatility, work ethic and inventiveness that allowed him to stake a claim on a first-team place at the age of 18.[102][103][104] Vicente del Bosque described him as "A complete footballer. He can attack and defend, he creates and scores," and Frank Rijkaard said, "I played him as a false winger, central midfielder, deep midfielder and just behind the striker and he was always excellent."[12] He was used initially as a wide-forward in the absence of Juan Román Riquelme and Ronaldinho by Louis van Gaal and Rijkaard respectively, but made his name as a world-class player in central midfield alongside or in lieu of Xavi, at both club and international level. As FIFA.com says, "It is in this position that his direct style and quick feet can be used to full effect, with the ball seeming glued to his toes as he races into threatening positions." A diminutive midfielder, Iniesta is a player known for his passing, technique, vision and movement;[12][105][106] he is also highly regarded for his ability to read the game, as well as his acceleration, and close control at speed, which — when combined with his low centre of gravity — has rendered him one of the most skilled dribblers of all time,[107] by allowing him to change direction quickly, get past opponents, and undertake individual runs with the ball, despite not being particularly quick. Moreover, his former manager Guardiola has praised him for "his mastery of the relationship between space and time," which he utilises to his advantage in order to disorient opposing players when in possession.[103][108][109][110][111][112] His signature move is La Croqueta – a move pioneered by Michael Laudrup and popularised by Iniesta – where he quickly pushes the ball from his right foot to his left which takes the ball away from an opponent, allowing him to get out of a tight situation.[113] His role has also been likened to that of a mezzala, in Italian football jargon, namely an offensive–minded box–to-box or central midfielder.[114]



"The one who plays this game the best is Iniesta: he knows exactly when to go forward and when to drop back. He picks the right moment to do everything: when to dribble, when to speed things up and when to slow things down. And I think that's the only thing that can't be taught or bought. You can learn how to shoot and how to control the ball, but being aware of everything that's happening out on the pitch – that's something you're either born with or you're not."

Much like other Barcelona youth products such as Pep Guardiola, Xavi and Iván de la Peña, Iniesta is a playmaker who relies on his technique, passing, intuition, movement and inventiveness to control the midfield, dictate the ebb and flow of play, and create chances or space for teammates.[12][116][117] Iniesta has been praised for his understanding and interplay with Xavi; former Barcelona teammate Giovanni van Bronckhorst said of the pair, "They have a special relationship, they always have, they just seem to know where the other one is."[118] Despite not being particularly prolific in front of goal, during his maturation as a player, he has gained a reputation of a big-game player for club and country, assisting a goal in each of the 2009, 2011 and 2015 UEFA Champions League finals,[119] as well as scoring the winner in the 2010 World Cup Final, not to sideline his vital contributions in the 2006 Champions League Final, the 2008 Euro Final and the 2012 Euro Final, being known for his ability to score from powerful strikes outside the box. He is also the only footballer in history to win the Man of the Match award in a World Cup Final, a Euro Final, and a Champions League Final.[120][102][110]
His willingness to play anywhere on the pitch has earned him the sobriquet El Ilusionista (The Illusionist), El Cerebro (The Brain), El Anti-Galáctico (a pun on Real Madrid players' nickname Los Galácticos), El Caballero Pálido (The Pale Knight)[121] and most recently Don Andrés from the Spanish press. Zinedine Zidane also praised Iniesta, stating on the Spanish radio station Cadena COPE, "Iniesta really impresses me. He's got so much influence in Spain's game. He reminds me of myself."[citation needed] He is widely regarded by many in the sport as one of the most respected and best midfielders of all time,[14][122][123][124] and as one of the greatest passers and playmakers in world football history.[125][126] Despite his reserved personality, he was also known for his leadership.[127]

Media and sponsorship[edit]
Iniesta had a sponsorship deal with sportswear company Nike, and has appeared in Nike commercials alongside Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar, Zlatan Ibrahimović and Wayne Rooney.[128] Iniesta features in EA Sports' FIFA video game series, and was the sixth-highest rated player in FIFA 15.[129] Iniesta's signature move, La Croqueta, features in FIFA 19.[130] In March 2015, Iniesta had the ninth highest social media rank in the world among sportspeople, with 24 million Facebook fans.[131] On 22 October 2018, Iniesta signed a new sponsorship deal with Japanese sportswear company Asics,[132] with his first signature boot being released on 15 July 2019.[133]

Personal life[edit]
Iniesta is married to Anna Ortiz; the couple began dating in 2008 and got married on 8 July 2012.[134] They have two daughters, born in 2011 and 2017, and two sons, born 2015[135] and 2019.[136] They lost an unborn child, a son, due to miscarriage in March 2014.[137] In February 2023, they welcomed their fifth child, a girl.[138] Iniesta is a Catholic.[139]
In 2011, Iniesta invested €420,000 in his boyhood club, Albacete, thus becoming its major shareholder.[140] Two years later, with the club facing administrative relegation to the fourth tier of Spanish football, he loaned them a further €240,000 to cover unpaid wages.[141]
In May 2018, Iniesta revealed to Risto Mejide that he suffered from depression before the 2010 FIFA World Cup due to his injuries and the death of Daniel Jarque.[142][143] 
In September 2018, Iniesta alongside German footballer Lukas Podolski campaigned and donated money for the victims of the Hokkaido Eastern Iburi earthquake in Japan.[144]

*Club domestic league appearances and goals
Gerard Piqué Bernabeu (born 2 February 1987) is a Spanish former professional footballer who played as a centre-back. He is considered to be one of the best defenders of his generation.[2][3]
Initially a talented student athlete at Barcelona's La Masia academy, Piqué began his professional career with Manchester United in 2004. He returned to Barcelona in 2008 and helped the club win trebles in 2008–09 and 2014–15. He appeared in 616 competitive matches for the club and won 31 major club titles, including nine La Liga trophies and three UEFA Champions League titles. He is one of only four players to have won the Champions League two years in a row with different teams, the others being Marcel Desailly, Paulo Sousa and Samuel Eto'o.
Piqué also represented Spain 102 times, making his debut on 11 February 2009. He played an integral role on the Spanish teams that won the 2010 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2012. He retired from the national team after the 2018 FIFA World Cup.


Club career[edit]
Early life and career[edit]
Gerard Piqué Bernabeu[4] was born on 2 February 1987[5] in Barcelona, Catalonia.[1] He started his career playing for FC Barcelona's youth teams as a defensive midfielder, but before he signed his first professional contract with the club, he decided to join Manchester United. The Premier League club did not pay a fee for Piqué as he was too young to have a professional contract.[6]

Manchester United[edit]
Piqué made his debut for Manchester United in October 2004, as a centre-back, a 67th minute replacement for John O'Shea in a 3–0 League Cup victory at Crewe Alexandra.[7] He made his full debut in January 2005 in a 0–0 FA Cup draw with Exeter City. Piqué made his Premier League debut on 15 October 2005, again as a substitute for O'Shea, in a 3–1 win over Sunderland. His first league start came on 29 March 2006 against West Ham United at Old Trafford, playing at right-back, as Gary Neville was unavailable due to injury.[8]
His performances, most notably in the reserve team, earned him a new contract, which he signed in February 2005, to run until the summer of 2009. On 4 August 2006, however, La Liga club Real Zaragoza secured Piqué on a season-long loan. The terms of the loan required Piqué to feature in at least 20 games for the Aragonese club,[9] which he did, as he made 22 first team appearances in a successful spell, alongside Argentine Gabriel Milito, either as a centre-back or a defensive midfielder.[citation needed]
On 5 May 2007, it was announced that Piqué would be staying at Old Trafford for the following season. Manager Alex Ferguson had intended to assess Piqué's form at La Romareda on 6 May, prior to a meeting where the two parties would discuss Piqué's future prospects with the club. However, Ferguson was unable to attend because of airline difficulties.[10]
Piqué's return to Old Trafford saw him make nine league appearances during the 2007–08 season. In his first start in the UEFA Champions League, a 4–0 home win against Dynamo Kyiv on 7 November 2007, Piqué scored the first of Manchester United's four goals in that match.[11] In doing so, he became the 450th player to score at least one goal for the club.[12] His second goal for the club also came in the Champions League, in an away match with Roma on 12 December 2007.[13]

Return to Barcelona[edit]
Piqué during the 2008 Joan Gamper Trophy
On 27 May 2008, Piqué signed a four-year contract with Barcelona, with a €5 million buy-out clause.[14] Barcelona paid a £5 million fee for the player.[15] He expressed his joy at re-signing with his boyhood club, although he admitted he had enjoyed his spell at Manchester United:

I am very happy to be back, I didn't think I would be here again but this is very good for me. Manchester United is a great club and I enjoyed winning things. To play with world class players has helped me and now I want to continue this at Barça.
Piqué's first goal for Barcelona came in the club's 5–2 2008–09 UEFA Champions League group stage win at Sporting CP on 26 November.[16][17] His first domestic goal for the club followed two months later, on 29 January 2009, in a Copa del Rey match against local rivals Espanyol. The goal, which came from a corner kick in the 57th minute, turned out to be the game winner in a 3–2 victory for Barcelona.[18][19] On 2 May, Piqué scored Barcelona's sixth goal in a 6–2 El Clásico win against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu.[20][21]
On 13 May, he picked up the first trophy of his Barcelona career as he helped his club to a 4–1 victory over Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey Final.[22] Three days later, Barcelona clinched the 2008–09 La Liga title after Real Madrid lost 3–2 to Villarreal, with two games left in the season.[23] On 27 May, Piqué played against his former club Manchester United in the 2009 Champions League Final, which Barcelona won 2–0 in Rome,[24] completing a historic treble and becoming the first Spanish club to achieve this feat.[25]
On 19 December 2009, Piqué was in the Barcelona team which beat Argentine club Estudiantes 2–1 in the 2009 FIFA Club World Cup Final at Abu Dhabi to complete an unprecedented sextuple. Piqué assisted Pedro's 89th minute equalising goal which took the match to extra-time.[26] On 26 February 2010, Piqué signed a contract extension to keep him at Barcelona until at least summer 2015.[27][28] On 28 April, Piqué scored in Barcelona's 1–0 Champions League semi-final second leg victory against Inter Milan, though his team went out 3–2 on aggregate.[29]
On 7 December 2010, Piqué captained his first match for Barcelona, a 5–0 victory against Russian club Rubin Kazan at Camp Nou in the last Champions League group stage match, in the absence of regular captain Carles Puyol and vice-captain Xavi.[30] On 28 May 2011, Piqué played in his second Champions League Final. Barcelona defeated Manchester United 3–1 at Wembley Stadium to lift the UEFA Champions League for the second time in three seasons.[31]
On 18 December 2011, Piqué started in Barcelona's 4–0 victory against Brazilian club Santos in the 2011 FIFA Club World Cup Final at Yokohama.[32]
On 20 May 2014, Piqué signed a contract extension with Barcelona, keeping him at the club until 2019.[33]
On 6 June 2015, Piqué started for Barcelona in the 2015 UEFA Champions League Final, as the club won its fifth European Cup/Champions League title by beating Juventus 3–1 at Berlin's Olympiastadion.[34] This made Barcelona the first club in history to win the treble of domestic league, domestic cup, and European Cup twice.[35] Piqué, Xavi, Lionel Messi, Andrés Iniesta, Sergio Busquets, Dani Alves, and Pedro are the only players to have been a part of both treble-winning teams.[35]
On 20 December 2015, Piqué played in the 2015 FIFA Club World Cup Final against Argentine club River Plate in Yokohama, with Barcelona winning 3–0.[36]
On 18 January 2018, Piqué extended his contract again, this time until 2022.[37] On 25 August 2019, he played for a full 90 minutes in a 5–2 win against Real Betis, his 500th game for the club.[38]
On 20 October 2020, Piqué signed a contract extension that would keep him at the club until 20 June 2024, setting his buy-out clause at €500 million.[39] On 3 March 2021, Piqué scored a last-minute header in the Copa del Rey semi-finals against Sevilla, tying the aggregate score to send the game to extra time. Barcelona won the game 3–0 in extra time and advanced to the 2021 Copa del Rey Final,[40] which the team won.[41]
On 3 November 2022, Piqué announced that he would retire following Barcelona's La Liga match against Almería on 5 November.[42] Starting as captain,[citation needed] he was substituted off to a standing ovation in the 84th minute of Barcelona's 2–0 win. The Barcelona players were wearing special shirts for the game with "SEMPR3" printed on the front and Piqué's name and number on the back; "sempre" means "always" in Catalan, with Piqué's shirt number three replacing the last "e".[43] La Liga president Javier Tebas stated he had no doubt that Piqué would one day return and become a "great president of Barcelona".[44] Piqué was still on the squad list, named as a substitute, for the final match before 2022 FIFA World Cup, away against Osasuna on 8 November; he was given a straight red card from the bench at half time after arguing with the referee over the second-yellow red card given to teammate Robert Lewandowski in the first half.[45]

International career[edit]
Youth teams[edit]
Piqué was a member of the Spain under-19 team that won the 2006 UEFA European Under-19 Championship in Poland.[46] In a 2–1 final win against Scotland, Piqué put in a strong performance in defence and also contributed in attack, hitting the crossbar with a header and providing the assist for striker Alberto Bueno to score Spain's second goal.[47]
Subsequently, he played in the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup, starting all six of Spain's matches and scoring a goal in the team's come-from-behind 4–2 victory over Brazil in the round of 16.[48] However, Piqué missed the deciding penalty in the shoot-out against the Czech Republic, and Spain was eliminated at the quarter-final stage.[49]

Senior side[edit]

On 6 February 2009, Piqué was called up to the senior squad for the friendly against England on 11 February.[50] He played the entire match in a 2–0 win, in Seville.[51] In his second match as an international on 28 March 2009, he was called up as a replacement for injured teammate Carles Puyol and he scored the only goal in Spain's victory in the 2010 World Cup qualifier against Turkey at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid.[52] Four days later, he started in Istanbul in a 2–1 win, also in the group stage.[53] Piqué made his tournament debut for Spain at the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup, starting in four of the team's five matches as La Roja finished in third place.[citation needed]
Piqué was Spain's first-choice centre-back at the 2010 World Cup finals in South Africa, playing alongside Puyol. He started all seven matches as Spain won the tournament, defeating the Netherlands 1–0 in the final.[54] Piqué's partnership with Puyol saw Spain concede only twice in seven World Cup matches and keep four consecutive clean sheets in the knockout stage. In Spain's 1–0 group stage defeat to Switzerland, just before Gelson Fernandes scored the only goal of the game, Swiss striker Eren Derdiyok tumbled over Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas and accidentally kicked Piqué in the face, knocking him over and leaving him with a deep cut beside his right eye.[55]
Piqué played every minute of Spain's UEFA Euro 2012 campaign, partnering Sergio Ramos in the centre of defence. He successfully converted the team's third penalty in a semi-final shoot-out win over Portugal. In the final, Spain recorded a fifth consecutive clean sheet in a 4–0 win over Italy.[56] Piqué was one of three Spanish defenders included in UEFA's Team of the Tournament as La Roja conceded only one goal in six matches.[57]
At the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, Piqué was the third of Spain's seven successful takers in a 7–6 shootout win over Italy at the semi-final stage. On 30 June 2013, Piqué was sent off during the final against Brazil. He received a straight red card in the 68th minute for a violent tackle on recently signed Barcelona teammate Neymar. The match finished 3–0 to Brazil, ending Spain's world record 29 match unbeaten run in competitive internationals.[58]
In Spain's opening group game of UEFA Euro 2016 on 13 June, Piqué scored his fifth goal for his country, a late header in a 1–0 victory against the Czech Republic.[59]
In Spain's second group match of the 2018 FIFA World Cup on 20 June, a 1–0 win against Iran, Piqué made his 100th international appearance.[60]
On 11 August 2018, Piqué announced his retirement from international football.[61]
On 25 March 2019, Piqué won his 10th cap for Catalonia in a friendly match against Venezuela, a few months after he had retired from the Spanish national team and led the team to a 2–1 victory.[62]

Style of play[edit]
Piqué was a modern and commanding defender, who combined strength and tackling ability with good technique and passing. Due to his height and physical attributes, he was good in the air. Although he was primarily deployed as a centre-back, he was a tactically versatile player who was capable of playing as a defensive midfielder, a position in which he was initially deployed in his youth; he was also deployed as a sweeper on occasion, showing similarities to German legend Franz Beckenbauer, thus earning the sobriquet "Piquénbauer".[6][63][64] He was also occasionally known to use his height as an additional attacking threat by advancing into more offensive positions, often functioning as an auxiliary striker, particularly if his team were trailing late on during matches.[64][65][66] His ball-playing ability and capacity to read the game enabled him to form an effective central-defensive partnership with the more physical Carles Puyol, both with Barcelona and Spain.[67][68] Despite his talent in his youth, he was initially accused by certain pundits of being error-prone defensively,[69][70] and has been criticised on occasion for his inconsistency and lack of pace.[71][72] Considered to be one of the best defenders in world football by pundits,[73] in 2018, Piqué's former defensive partner Puyol described him as "the best centre-back in the world" due to his personal development as a player in terms of his intelligence, leadership, positional sense, composure, and anticipation.[74]

Personal life[edit]
Piqué was raised in a Catalan family. His father, Joan, is a businessman, and his mother, Montserrat, is the director of a spinal injuries hospital in Barcelona. He has a younger brother, Marc.[75][76] His grandfather, Amador Bernabeu, is a former vice-president of FC Barcelona.[77] During the 2017 Catalan independence referendum, he was seen by many as one of the public faces of the pro-independence movement, voting and tweeting his support in Catalan.[78] He subsequently faced backlash from some Spanish fans for his support of the Catalan independence referendum.[79]
From 2011 to 2022, Piqué was in a relationship with Colombian singer Shakira.[80] They met when he appeared in the music video for her single "Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)", the official song of the 2010 FIFA World Cup.[81] Piqué and Shakira share the same birthday, ten years apart. They have two sons together,[82][83] named Milan (born on 22 January 2013)[84] and Sasha (born on 29 January 2015).[85] In June 2022, the couple confirmed in a joint statement that they were separating.[86] Piqué has been in a relationship with Clara Chía Martí since 2022.[87][88]
Piqué was the face of Mango's men's line HE for four consecutive campaign seasons between 2011 and 2012.[89][90] In 2012, he lent his voice to the Catalan version of The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists! as the Pirate King.[citation needed]

Media and business interests[edit]
Piqué is the founder and president of Kosmos Holding (Kosmos Global Holding S.L.), a sports and media investment group he founded with Hiroshi Mikitani (founder and chairman of Japanese e-commerce firm Rakuten, Inc.), Edmund Chu, Nullah Sarker, and Mike Evans.[91] Kosmos struck a deal with the International Tennis Federation for a 25-year, $3 billion partnership to transform the Davis Cup and generate substantial revenues for global tennis development.[92] In August 2018, U.S. billionaire Larry Ellison publicly stated his support of Kosmos and his intention to invest in the Kosmos-ITF partnership.[93] In January 2023 however, the International Tennis Federation removed Piqué and Kosmos from the partnership.[94]
Piqué is the owner of Spanish second division football club FC Andorra, which he bought in December 2018 through his firm Kosmos Holding. On 21 May 2022, the team was promoted to the Segunda División after beating already relegated UCAM Murcia 1–0 at home, thus ascending to the second tier for the first time in their history. In July 2019, Piqué took over a majority stake in another Spanish football club – Gimnàstic Manresa. The acquisition was completed through Kosmos.[95]
In December 2020, Piqué invested in the fantasy football game Sorare.[96] Kosmos bought the Spanish broadcasting rights for the 2021 Copa América in a partnership with streamer Ibai Llanos,[97] and in 2021 he and Ibai founded and became co-owners of the esports team KOI.[98] The esports team later acquired a majority interest in Rogue, which resulted in Piqué's team competing in the League of Legends European Championship.[99] As of 11 November 2022, he is president and owner of the Kings League, a new format football league in Barcelona, made up of teams whose owners are content creators from Twitch, YouTube, TikTok and Instagram.[100]

Philanthropy[edit]
In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic Piqué (along with teammates, including Lionel Messi) committed to a 70% salary cut throughout the crisis. They further committed to donating to the salaries of all employees at the club during the state of emergency.[101]

Tax fraud[edit]
On 10 July 2019, Piqué was ordered by a Spanish court to pay €2.1 million to the tax authorities following his conviction for image rights fraud. He had been convicted by Spain's National Court in 2016 for faking the sale of his image rights to his Kerad Project company to evade taxes from 2008 to 2010.[102]

*Club domestic league appearances and goals
David Josué Jiménez Silva (born 8 January 1986) is a Spanish former professional footballer who played mainly as a central or an attacking midfielder but also played as a winger or second striker. His passing ability and possession-retaining qualities earned him the nicknames Merlin (reference to the legendary wizard Merlin) and El Mago from his teammates and fans. He is considered one of the greatest midfielders of his generation and one of Manchester City's greatest ever players.
Silva spent seven years of his professional career with Valencia, playing from 2004 to 2010, and won the Copa del Rey in 2008. In the summer of 2010, he moved to Manchester City and appeared in over 400 matches for the club,[3] winning four Premier League titles, two FA Cups and five League Cups. Silva was also named in the PFA Team of the Year three times and is the youngest player to reach 200 wins in the Premier League. He left Manchester City in 2020 after a ten-year tenure and returned to La Liga with Real Sociedad, where he won his second Copa del Rey in 2020.[4][5] Later on, he sustained an anterior cruciate ligament injury during preseason training with Real Sociedad, which forced him to retire in July 2023.[6]
Silva represented Spain, from his debut for the senior team in 2006 until his international retirement in 2018. He formed a midfield partnership with Xavi and Andrés Iniesta which led to three consecutive international tournament victories – UEFA Euro 2008, 2010 FIFA World Cup, and UEFA Euro 2012. One of 13 Spanish players to have amassed 100 caps, Silva scored 35 goals for Spain, making him the 4th highest goalscorer in their history, and also provided 29 assists, making him the second-highest assist provider in their history.


Early life[edit]
David Silva was born in Arguineguín, Gran Canaria, Canary Islands, to Fernando Jiménez, a former municipal police officer who eventually was responsible for the safety of the Valencia CF stadium and Eva Silva. His father, Fernando, is Spanish (Canarian) while his mother, Eva, is of Japanese descent, claimed by the Canarian media.[7]
David Silva began playing football in the youth team of UD San Fernando, near Maspalomas. Originally, he played as a goalkeeper, before becoming a winger and mirrored his game around his footballing idol as a youth, Michael Laudrup.[8] When he was 14, he received an offer to become a youth player at Valencia CF, which he accepted. He stayed in Valencia's youth set-up until he was 17.

Club career[edit]
Valencia[edit]
A product of Valencia's youth system, Silva made his professional debut in 2004–05, with Segunda División's Eibar, while on loan from Valencia, playing 35 league games and scoring on five occasions. In the following season, he was again out on loan, this time to Celta de Vigo, where he played 34 matches, scoring four goals. After two late substitute appearances, the first in a 2–0 home win over Málaga on 28 August 2005, Silva finished as an undisputed starter as the Galician side reached the UEFA Cup straight from the second-tier.

Silva playing for Valencia in August 2008Silva returned to Valencia in the summer of 2006, becoming an automatic first-choice despite his young age of 20. In two seasons combined, he only missed six matches and netted 14 goals, his first league goal coming on 5 November 2006 in a 1–1 draw at Espanyol. In August 2008, he extended his contract by five years, amidst interest of several Premier League teams.[9] He won the Copa del Rey 2008, his first title in Spain.
After not appearing in the first three months of 2008–09 due to a chronic ankle ailment,[10] Silva returned to the call-ups in mid-December. On 3 January 2009, he scored twice in a 3–1 home win over Atlético Madrid,[11] still contributing with 19 matches (four goals) as the Che qualified for the Europa League.
In the 2009–10 season, Silva scored a career-best eight goals, as Valencia finished in third position and returned to the UEFA Champions League. On 15 April 2010, he scored a brace against Athletic Bilbao for a 2–0 home win,[12] adding three assists in the 4–4 thriller at Werder Bremen for the Europa League's round of 16.[13]

Manchester City[edit]
2010–11: Debut season, ending the trophy drought[edit]
Silva with Manchester City in April 2011
On 30 June 2010, Manchester City announced that they had reached an agreement with Valencia over the transfer of Silva and that he would join the club on a four-year deal, prior to the start of the 2010–11 season.[14] On 14 July, the Premier League side completed the signing[15] and Silva was awarded the number 21 shirt, the same number he wore for Valencia and when playing for Spain. Manchester City had previously tried to sign Silva and his Valencia teammate David Villa in 2008, but were put off when Valencia quoted a £135 million combined price tag on both players.[16]
City manager Roberto Mancini mainly deployed Silva as a winger[17] and later in a trequartista role in his first season.[18] Silva made his Premier League debut on 14 August 2010 in a 0–0 draw against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane.[19] He scored his first goal for the club on 16 September, eight minutes into the Europa League group match against Red Bull Salzburg.[20] On 17 October, he scored his first league goal in a game against Blackpool, netting City's third goal in a 3–2 away win.[21] He received three consecutive Manchester City Player of the Month awards from October to December 2010.[22]
Following his debut season in the Premier League, Silva emerged as one of the league's finest playmakers. Carlos Tevez lauded him as "the best signing we [Manchester City] have made."[23] Silva finished the 2010–11 campaign with four goals and seven assists in 35 league appearances.[24]

2011–12: Premier League win, assist leader[edit]
Silva prior to a league match against Liverpool in 2011
Silva began the 2011–12 season in fine form, scoring the third goal in City's 4–0 thrashing of Swansea City[25] and was voted man of the match. He also scored the following week against Bolton Wanderers, and was again named man of the match.[26] Silva then set up two of Sergio Agüero's three goals in City's second home game against Wigan Athletic. He was beginning to form a great understanding with the Argentine, with the pair having combined to score three goals already. After a series of magnificent displays from Silva, City boss Roberto Mancini compared him to fellow Spain internationals Xavi and Andrés Iniesta and said that Silva is "one of the best players in the world."[27] On 1 October, Silva was awarded the Premier League Player of the Month for his outstanding performances, making it the first time ever that two Manchester City players have won the award in back-to-back months with Edin Džeko winning it the month before.[28]
In the first Manchester Derby of the season at Old Trafford, Manchester City won 6–1, with Silva proving, yet again, to be instrumental in the Manchester City attack, scoring the fifth goal, setting up Edin Džeko's second with a chested volley pass through the United defense, and participating in the first two goals with excellent passing to James Milner to assist Mario Balotelli.[29] He was described as having been "two steps ahead of all the United players" in the aftermath of the match.[30] On 25 October 2011, in an interview with a Spanish radio station, Silva revealed that he turned down Barcelona and Real Madrid so he could sign for City, and that he wants to stay at the club for years. He commented, "Madrid and Barcelona are great teams, but I'm happy here and I would like to stay here for many years."[31] Former City and England defender Earl Barrett said he is almost impossible to stop due to his ability to create space[32] and Andy Cole, who mostly played for Manchester United, has stated that Silva "is a joy to watch."[33]
Having done well to cut the gap between them and Manchester United to just three points, City went into April's Manchester Derby knowing that a win would be enough to send them top of the Premier League on goal difference. In a match widely billed as the biggest game in Premier League history,[34] Silva delivered a corner which was headed home by Vincent Kompany for the winner.[34] City triumphed 1–0, and returned to the league summit having been eight points behind their city rivals as recently as the start of that month.[35]
On 13 May 2012, with City heading into the final day of the season needing a win over QPR to secure their first top flight title in 44 years, Silva delivered a cross for Edin Džeko to score the equaliser in the 91st minute of the match. In addition to winning his first Premier League medal with Manchester City, he also finished the season on top of the assists table with 15 assists to his name[36] and was one of four City players who made it in the PFA's Premier League Team of the Year.[37]

On 17 September 2012, Silva signed a new five-year deal at City, committing himself to the Etihad Stadium until 2017.[38]
Just six days after signing his new contract, Silva got off the mark in the 2012–13 Premier League season, registering an assist for Joleon Lescott in a 1–1 draw with Arsenal.[39] He followed this up with another assist the following week, as he played in Aguero to score against Fulham at Craven Cottage.[40] He injured himself playing for Spain in October, which meant he had to miss three games for Manchester City. On 11 November, he provided the crucial assist, a lofted through-ball, to striker Edin Džeko, who converted in the 88th minute to steal a 2–1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur.[41] His first league goal of the season came in a 5–0 thrashing of Aston Villa at home in the very next league match, on 17 November.
On 19 January 2013, Silva scored twice against Fulham at home in a 2–0 win. On 9 March, he scored the fifth and final goal in Manchester City's 5–0 win against Barnsley at the City of Manchester Stadium in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup, sealing progression to the semi-finals. Despite missing the clash with Chelsea through injury, City prevailed 2–1 through goals from Aguero and Samir Nasri, leading them to their second FA Cup Final in three seasons.[42] They would face relegation-threatened Wigan Athletic at Wembley. Silva started the match and played the full 90 minutes, but the Blues were rocked by a Pablo Zabaleta red card, with a late Ben Watson header compounding their misery.[43] It was one of the great FA Cup upsets, and ended up costing City boss Mancini his job.[44]
In the penultimate Premier League game against Reading, Silva made a superb pass to Džeko which took the entire Reading defense out of the game.[45] Džeko scored, sealing a 0–2 win in City's first match since the sacking of Roberto Mancini. Silva finished the season with four goals and ten assists in 32 league appearances for a City squad that finished runners-up to city rivals Manchester United for the Premier League title.

2013–14: Premier League and League Cup double[edit]
The 2013–14 Premier League season was a tough one for Silva, as numerous injuries limited him to just 27 league appearances. Nonetheless, he did well to maintain his stellar record of goals and assists for Manchester City. On 19 August 2013, Silva scored Manchester City's opening goal of the campaign in a 4–0 win against Newcastle United at the City of Manchester Stadium.[46] He followed this up with an assist in the 3–2 defeat at Cardiff, crossing for Alvaro Negredo to score.[47] On 5 October, Silva began one of his most productive spells in the Premier League. Making his first league start since August following a number of injury setbacks,[48] he assisted Sergio Aguero to score against Everton,[49] before scoring once and setting up another in a 3–1 victory over West Ham.[50] Silva then scored again in the 7–0 home win over Norwich on 2 November, but his good form was curtailed by a calf injury, which ruled him out of City's next six games.
He made his return on 14 December, scoring at home in a 6–3 win over Arsenal,[51] before setting up goals in each of the next two games against Fulham and Liverpool. Silva was also enjoying one of his most productive UEFA Champions League campaigns to date, having managed three assists and a goal in Group D, including a strike in a 3–2 win over champions Bayern Munich[48] in December.
City had also progressed deep into the League Cup, eliminating Leicester and Newcastle to reach the semi-final, where they would face West Ham United. Silva played 73 minutes of the first leg, which City won by a large 6–0 scoreline,[52] meaning he was rested for the return leg (a routine 3–0 win). He was restored to the starting lineup in the final, where goals from Yaya Touré, Nasri and substitute Jesús Navas earned City their first League Cup triumph since 1976.[53]
The month of March was a productive one for Silva, as he registered two goals and two assists in the league, along with a slew of excellent performances. He was named Manchester City's Player of the Month for March 2014, after scoring in away matches against Hull City and Arsenal.[54] Silva followed this up with a goal and assist against Liverpool at Anfield, but could not prevent the Blues slipping to a 3–2 defeat.[55] However, following a strong run of form in the final five games of the season, City pipped the Merseysiders to the title, and Silva claimed his second Premier League winners medal to add to the one from 2011–12. He ended the campaign with eight goals and 16 assists in all competitions.

2014–15: Contract extension, Premier League runner-up[edit]
Silva playing in the 2014 FA Community Shield against Arsenal
On 10 August, Silva played in the 2014 FA Community Shield, a match City lost 3–0 to Arsenal.[56] Two days later, he signed a five-year contract extension with City.[57] Like the previous season, on 17 August, Silva scored Manchester City's opening goal of the 2014–15 Premier League season in a 2–0 away win against Newcastle United. Silva then scored against West Brom on Boxing Day.[58]
On 21 February 2015, Silva scored a brace against Newcastle United in a 5–0 win.[59] He won the Etihad Player of the Month award for his performances in February.[60][61] On 4 March, Silva scored in 1–0 win against Leicester City to take him to ten league goals in a season for the first time in his career.[62][63] Jamie Redknapp described him as a "maestro" for his performances for City,[64] while his teammate Edin Džeko called him "the best player in the Premier League."[65][66][67]
Three days later, City took on Barcelona at the Etihad Stadium in the first leg of their UEFA Champions League Round of 16 clash. The Blues were largely blown away by Barcelona's immense quality, but the game was marked by an ingenious backheel flick from Silva to Aguero, who scored to pull one back for City.[68]
On 19 April, in a 2–0 victory over West Ham, Silva was caught in the face by the elbow of Cheikhou Kouyaté, requiring eight minutes of treatment before being substituted for Samir Nasri.[69] Tests confirmed that he had not fractured his cheekbone.[70]
On 10 May, Silva scored a goal in City's 6–0 win over Queens Park Rangers, which resulted in the latter's relegation.[71] He ended the campaign with 12 goals and 10 assists in all competitions, with all 12 strikes coming in the Premier League- a career high.

2015–16: UEFA Champions League semi-final[edit]
In the opening match of the Premier League season, in a 0–3 win at West Brom, Silva delivered a performance his manager Manuel Pellegrini labelled "unbelievable".[72] As well as assisting the team's third goal, a clever backheel flick on Yaya Touré's long range drive sent the ball spinning into the net.[73] After providing another three assists for the team in August (in wins against Chelsea and Watford),[74][75] Silva was nominated for both of the Manchester City and Premier League Player of the Month Awards for August, winning the former.[76][77]
Silva was injured for most of October and November after picking up an ankle injury, while playing for Spain on 9 October.[78][79] He made his return, as a 75th-minute substitute, in a 3–1 league defeat of Southampton on 28 November.[80] He netted the opener in the last UEFA Champions League group stage match on 8 December, in a 4–2 home defeat of Borussia Mönchengladbach, which resulted in Manchester City topping their group for the first time.[81] Silva provided another three assists in home victories against Tyne-Wear rivals Newcastle United and Sunderland.[82][83]
Silva warming up before a preseason match against Tottenham in July 2017
In a 4–0 home league win against Crystal Palace on 16 January 2016, Silva scored one, set-up another two goals and played a key pass in the remaining goal.[84][85] Having started every match of City's League Cup campaign since the quarter-final stage, he started the 2016 Football League Cup Final on 28 February, playing 110 minutes against Liverpool as the match went to extra time.[86] He was replaced 10 minutes from time by Wilfried Bony, and Manchester City went on to defeat the Reds 3–1 on penalties, with Silva winning his second League Cup with the club.[87] He claimed another brace of assists in a 4–0 home defeat of Aston Villa six days later.[88]
On 24 February, Silva scored City's second as they beat Dynamo Kyiv 3–1 in the first leg of their Champions League Round of 16 tie, his second strike of the European campaign.[89] He proceeded to start City's next four games in the competition, as the Blues made their deepest run in history, reaching the semi-finals. However, having started as one of City's brightest players in the semi-final first leg against Real Madrid, Silva was forced off after just 40 minutes due to injury. This caused him to miss the second leg at the Santiago Bernabeu,[90] and his team suffered in his absence- the Blues were beaten 1–0 on the night and on aggregate.[91] Pellegrini lamented the loss of his main playmaker, asserting that the absence of Silva had crippled his side and hamstrung their ability to create chances.[92]
Silva ended the campaign with four goals and 12 assists in 36 matches, a disappointing campaign for him personally, and one in which he missed 22 matches due to a persistent ankle injury, amongst other issues. Nonetheless, it was a trophy-winning season, the ninth major honour of his career.

2016–17: Manchester City Player of the Year[edit]
With Pep Guardiola arriving as Manchester City's new manager to much fanfare, it was the beginning of a new era for City. Having put pen to paper on a three-year contract with the Blues,[93] the legendary manager stated that one of the reasons he had come to the club was to work with Silva, whom he described as a special player, and one of the best he had ever trained.[94] In Guardiola's first season at the club, Silva scored one goal in a 5–0 win over Steaua București in the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League play-off round.[95] He enjoyed a relatively productive European campaign that season- having provided an assist for Raheem Sterling against Celtic, he later scored the equalising goal in a 1–1 draw against Borussia Mönchengladbach in the group stage.[96] The Blues progressed to the knockout stages where they would face Monaco in the Round of 16, but despite another pinpoint Silva cross to assist Aguero, City crashed out of the tournament on away goals following a 6–6 aggregate draw.[97]
In the league, despite a bright opening to the campaign when City stormed to the top of the table, it proved a difficult season for the Blues, as they eventually fell away and ended up finishing third, 15 points behind winners Chelsea. It was a season in transition for the team, who under Guardiola were beginning to implement a distinct footballing philosophy.
Despite the team's under-performance, Silva ended the campaign with eight goals and 11 assists in all competitions, and he beat off competition from Sergio Aguero and Kevin De Bruyne to be named Manchester City's Player of the Season.[98] It was his second time being recognised as such, following his winning of the award in 2011–12, with the Spaniard fast becoming one of Pep Guardiola's favourites in the City side.

2017–18: Third Premier League and League Cup win[edit]
Silva started the 2017–18 season with yet another display of finesse, providing eight Premier League assists in 14 appearances, which was the highest total for any player in Europe's top five leagues.[99] The 2017–18 season was an especially difficult time for the Spaniard, with his newborn son having been born extremely prematurely. This led to him having to jet back and forth between England and Spain to visit his son and partner in a hospital in Madrid.[100] Despite this, Silva continued to produce excellent performances, and on 30 November 2017, he signed a one-year contract extension with Manchester City keeping him at the club until 2020.[101] On 10 December, Silva scored the winner in a closely fought Manchester Derby at Old Trafford, stabbing the ball past David de Gea from close range.[102]
Silva was forced to miss a crucial game against Tottenham Hotspur at the Etihad Stadium in December, as he was with his son in Spain.[103] In his absence, City delivered a sumptuous performance, smashing Tottenham 4–1 following an urging from manager Pep Guardiola to secure the win for Silva and his partner Yessica.[104] Midfielder Kevin De Bruyne held his fingers up to show the number 21, Silva's shirt number, after scoring City's second, in a touching tribute to the Spaniard.[105] Manchester City ended up winning the Premier League with a record 100 point tally, leading to the team being nicknamed The Centurions.[106] The 19 point gap to second-placed Manchester United was also a record winning margin, which stands to this day.
Silva also scored in the 2018 EFL Cup Final against Arsenal.[107] For his contributions, Silva was nominated for the PFA Player of the Year and named in the PFA Team of the Year for the second time as City won the Premier League.[108] It was the third Premier League title of Silva's career and his second time being named in the PFA Team of the Year, and he finished the season with 10 goals and 14 assists across all competitions.[109]

2018–19: Four titles in one season[edit]
On 15 September 2018, in a 3–0 home win over Fulham, Silva scored his 50th Premier League goal in his 253rd appearance in the competition, also making his 350th appearance for Manchester City in the same match.[110][111][112][113] City and Liverpool went head to head in an absorbing title race, which ended up with City pipping the Reds to the title by a single point.[114]
It was a remarkable season for the Blues, as they went on to win the Community Shield, League Cup and FA Cup too, with Silva scoring in the final of the latter tournament.[115] In doing this, they became the first club in English football history to win all four domestic honours in a single season.[116] Silva played in 33 of City's 38 league games, registering 10 goals and 14 assists in all competitions as he picked up his second FA Cup, fourth League Cup and fourth Premier League title.

2019–20: Fifth League Cup win, departure, statue[edit]
Following the departure of Vincent Kompany in 2019, Silva inherited the club captaincy.[117] On 26 June 2019, Silva announced that he would leave Manchester City at the end of the 2019–20 season.[118] The campaign began with City facing Liverpool in the Community Shield at Wembley- City won on penalties following a 1–1 draw,[119] with Silva producing a brilliant pass to assist Raheem Sterling for City's goal. On 8 July, he provided two assists, the second of which was his 10th of the season, and scored a free kick as City beat Newcastle United 5–0. With the free kick goal, he reached 150 Premier League goals and assists, which only a few midfielders had done before.[120][121]
On 1 March 2020, City took on Aston Villa in the League Cup final,[122] their third such final in as many years and fifth in seven seasons. The Blues won 2–1, with goals from Sergio Aguero and Rodri, and lifted the trophy for the third time in a row. It was Silva's only trophy as captain of Manchester City, and his fifth League Cup title overall, making him the most decorated player in the competition's 60-year history.
On 26 July 2020, Silva played his final Premier League game for Manchester City, a 5–0 win over Norwich City. He was substituted late on in the match, to applause from all present.[123] Just under a month later, he played his last game in a City shirt, in a disappointing 3–1 defeat to Olympique Lyon in the Champions League quarter-finals, coming on as a late substitute.[124] At the age of 34, Silva ended the campaign with a respectable return of six goals and 11 assists in all competitions, enough to earn himself a third appearance in the PFA Team of the Year despite City's underwhelming season.[125]
On 17 August 2020, Manchester City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak announced plans for a statue of Silva, along with teammates Sergio Aguero and Vincent Kompany, to be installed at the Etihad Stadium to commemorate his 10-year "transformational" contribution at City.[126]
The statues of Silva and Kompany were unveiled on 28 August 2021.[127]

Real Sociedad[edit]
On 17 August 2020, Spanish club Real Sociedad announced the signing of Silva on a free transfer,[128] despite reports of a move to Italian side Lazio.[129]
Silva made his debut for the club in a 0–0 home draw against Real Madrid, coming on as a substitute in the second half.[130] On 25 October 2020, Silva provided two assists as La Real beat Huesca 4–1 in La Liga. A week later, he scored his first goal for the club, in a 4–1 away win against Celta Vigo.[131] Following his excellent performances for Sociedad, Silva was named in WhoScored's La Liga Team of the Month for November,[132] as well as being named Real Sociedad Player of the Month.[133]
On 21 February 2021, Silva once again provided two assists as Real Sociedad defeated Alaves 4–0 in the league.[134] This propelled La Real to 5th in the table, while Silva became the only player to provide two assists in two different La Liga games that season.[135]
On 3 April 2021, Silva started in and played 85 minutes of the 2020 Copa del Rey final against local rivals Athletic Bilbao. The match was settled by a 63rd-minute penalty from La Real captain Mikel Oyarzabal, after Cristian Portu had been brought down in the box.[136] Silva was substituted late in the game to a standing ovation from the Sociedad bench, and along with his teammates went on to lift the Copa Del Rey, Real Sociedad's first major trophy since 1987.[137] It was the 16th major honour of David Silva's career, and his second Copa Del Rey title. This final was postponed from a year earlier, so Silva and Carlos Fernández had taken no part in the other rounds played in the 2019−20 season.
On 21 July 2023, Silva ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament. Just 6 days later, on 27 July, he announced his retirement from football aged 37.[138]

International career[edit]
Silva being pressured by Italian defender Leonardo Bonucci in the UEFA Euro 2012 Final.
Silva first represented Spain in the 2003 FIFA U-17 World Championship in Finland, scoring three goals. In 2006, he became an under-21 international and scored four goals during the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship; this was enough to earn him joint-fourth place in the goal ranking, alongside Italian striker Graziano Pellè.
Silva made his senior international debut in the 1–0 friendly home defeat to Romania on 15 November 2006, and continued to receive call-ups to the side after good contributions in his first games. On 22 August 2007, he scored his first two goals for Spain, netting twice in a 3–2 friendly win versus Greece, and was then called up to the squad of 23 for UEFA Euro 2008.

UEFA Euro 2008[edit]
Silva started five of Spain's six matches at Euro 2008. In Spain's second group stage match against Sweden in Innsbruck, he assisted Fernando Torres with a pinpoint cross from the edge of the box,[139] with the former Liverpool forward scoring the opener in an eventual 2–1 win.
In the semi-finals game versus Russia, Silva scored the third goal for Spain after a quick counter-attack in which Cesc Fàbregas delivered a low cross, and he sent the ball into Igor Akinfeev's goal with his left foot.[140] In the final, he was involved in an incident with Germany's Lukas Podolski. After he pulled Podolski to the ground, the German approached Silva, which resulted in an angry exchange of words and a coming together of heads that the referee decided not to punish. Shortly afterward, Spanish coach Luis Aragonés substituted Silva for Santi Cazorla in an attempt to calm the tensions.[141]

2010 FIFA World Cup[edit]
After appearing regularly during 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification, Silva was also picked for the squad for the finals in South Africa.[142] He played in the first match against Switzerland which ended in a 1–0 defeat,[143] then against Germany in the semi-finals, as a late substitute in a 1–0 victory.[144]
Spain eventually won their first World Cup title after beating the Netherlands 1–0 after extra time in the final.[145]

UEFA Euro 2012 Qualifying[edit]
On 11 August 2010, during an international friendly with Mexico, Silva scored two minutes into second-half injury time, ending the game with a 1–1 draw.[146] In a Euro 2012 qualifier against Liechtenstein on 3 September 2010, Silva scored after 62 minutes, in a 4–0 away win.[147] The following month, in the same competition, he scored through a rare header, as the national team downed Lithuania in Salamanca (3–1).Silva (left) on the ball for Spain in the UEFA Euro 2012 FinalIn a friendly against Colombia on 9 February 2011, he came off the bench to score the game's only goal with just four minutes remaining, helping Spain to a hard-fought 1–0 win.[148] He scored twice and provided one assist in Spain's 3–1 victory against Scotland in their final match of the Euro 2012 qualifiers.[149] He scored the first goal in Spain's 2–2 comeback against Costa Rica, a friendly match where he came on as a substitute in the second half with Spain trailing 2–0.[150] He once again scored in a friendly against Venezuela to make the score 2–0 in a match that ended in a 5–0 win. Heading into Euro 2012, he scored in their pre-tournament friendly against China by finishing off a short give and go from Andrés Iniesta in the 84th minute.
UEFA Euro 2012[edit]
Silva was a starter in all six matches of Spain's Euro 2012 campaign. In their opening match of the tournament against Italy, he delivered a superb flicked through ball to Cesc Fàbregas,[151] who scored to level the game up at 1–1.
In Spain's second Group C match against the Republic of Ireland, Silva produced one of the performances of the tournament, scoring one and providing two assists in a 4–0 win.[152] His goal was mesmeric, as he left Sean St. Ledger on the floor and beat Stephen Ward before coolly slotting it past former Manchester City teammate Shay Given.[153]
In the 14th minute of the UEFA Euro 2012 Final, he headed home a Cesc Fàbregas cross, giving Spain a 1–0 lead.[154]
The match ended 4–0 and concluded the tournament in which Silva scored two goals and made three assists, the best efficiency (goals and assists) of any player at the Euros.[155] He was subsequently named in UEFA's Euro 2012 Team of the Tournament for his performances.[156] He also finished as the joint highest assist provider at the Euros, with three.[157]

2013 FIFA Confederations Cup[edit]
Silva was named in Vicente del Bosque's 23-man squad list for Spain's contestation of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, held in Brazil. On 20 June 2013, he scored two goals and assisted one for David Villa in Spain's 10–0 group stage demolition of Tahiti at the Maracanã.[158] Spain would go on to reach the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup Final, where they were soundly beaten 3–0 by hosts Brazil.[159]

2014 FIFA World Cup[edit]
Silva was part of Spain's 23-man squad which traveled to Brazil for the 2014 World Cup. With La Roja looking to defend the title they captured four years ago in South Africa, Silva started the opening match against the Netherlands in Bahia. However, they were unable to repeat their success over the Oranje from 2010, and succumbed to a 5–1 loss, despite taking an early lead.[160]
Silva started the second group stage game, against Chile, playing the full 90 minutes. However, it was another bad outing for the side, who were soundly beaten 2–0 and eliminated from the tournament.[161]
Despite the team's under-performance, Silva was one of the brighter sparks for La Roja, creating seven chances for his team, the most of any Spanish player at the World Cup.[162]

UEFA Euro 2016[edit]
Euro 2016 was one of Silva's best outings for the National Team at a major tournament. Starting in all four matches, Silva began the tournament with a show stopping display against the Czech Republic, in which he created six chances for his team- the most of any Spain player in a single match at the tournament.[163] The game ended in a 1–0 victory for the reigning European champions.[164]
In the second group game, a clash with Turkey in Nice, Silva was a key cog as Spain produced one of their best performances of the tournament, dispatching the Turks 3–0.[165] Silva was mesmeric throughout, and received a standing ovation from Spain and Turkey fans alike when he was substituted late in the game.
Silva played the full 90 minutes in La Roja's third group stage game against Croatia. It was an exceptional display, with the midfielder playing a sublime through ball to teammate Cesc Fàbregas, who squared for Alvaro Morata to score the opener. He later won a penalty, which was missed by Sergio Ramos, as Spain fell to a 2–1 defeat.[166] Despite this, Silva created five chances in the game, the second most of any Spain player in a Euro 2016 match, after himself.[167] Spain were eventually eliminated in the round of 16 by Italy, who beat them 2–0.[168]
Silva ended the tournament averaging 3.3 chances created per 90, the third highest at the tournament.[169]

Later years and retirement[edit]
Silva representing Spain at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.
Silva continued his goal scoring record under new boss Julen Lopetegui, scoring 9 times in 12 matches.[citation needed] In May 2018, Silva was named to Spain's squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.[170] He started all their matches in their World Cup campaign, which eventually ended with a 3–4 penalty shootout defeat to hosts Russia in the Round of 16.
After the 2018 World Cup, Silva announced his retirement from international football.[171] He ended his international career with 125 caps for Spain, having scored 35 goals. Following his retirement, Silva drew plaudits from many of his former teammates, being described as "one of the best ever"[172] and "one of the most talented players Spain has ever produced, without a shadow of a doubt"[172] by midfield partners Andres Iniesta and Xavi Hernandez. Vicente del Bosque, who led Spain to the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012 titles, even went as far as to declare Silva "Spain's Lionel Messi".[173]

Style of play[edit]


"He pulls the strings on the pitch. A brilliant footballer with great movement, he can score, assist, a player who decides a game. He’s got so much to his game, that I would consider him one of the best ever."


Andrés Iniesta[174]



"He’s a spectacular footballer. He has been throughout his career. For the national team he has been a cornerstone of that generation of highly talented Spanish footballers. David was a vital component and absolutely essential to that team - one of the most talented players Spain has ever produced, without a shadow of a doubt."[174]


Xavi

A talented and agile left-footed player,[175][176] Silva is known for having an excellent first touch, good dribbling skills, and outstanding technical ability, which, along with his intelligent attacking movements, allow him to retain possession in tight spaces, and to create space for himself and teammates to open up a defence.[177][178][179]
Silva's composure on the ball, as well as his vision, passing accuracy, ability to read the game, pick a pass, and control the tempo of his team's play have seen him become one of the best players in the world in his position, as well as one of the best midfielders in Premier League history, and earned him the nicknames Merlin (reference to the legendary wizard Merlin) and El Mago.[175][180][181][178][179][182][183][184] He is also considered one of the greatest midfielders of his generation and one of Manchester City's greatest ever players.[185][186][187][188][189]
Although he primarily serves as a playmaker for his team,[182] he is capable of scoring goals himself as well as creating them,[178][190] which enables him to be deployed in several offensive roles:[175][177] he is usually fielded in a free role as an attacking midfielder, where he is given space to roam the pitch,[191] but has also been used as a winger,[192] as a false 9,[177] as a second striker or as a deeper-lying central midfielder.[175][177][193]

Personal life[edit]
During December 2017, Silva had been missing games to return to Spain for personal reasons. On 3 January 2018, he said that his newborn son, Mateo, had been born extremely prematurely and was fighting to stay alive.[100] On 11 May 2018, Mateo was reported as healthy and was allowed to come home.[194]
Silva is a devout Catholic.

*Club domestic league appearances and goals
Carles Puyol Saforcada (Catalan: [ˈkaɾləs puˈjɔl səfuɾˈkaðə], Spanish: [ˈkaɾles puˈʝol safoɾˈkaða]; born 13 April 1978) is a Spanish former professional footballer who played his entire career for Barcelona. He mainly played as a centre-back, but he could also play in either full-back position, mostly as a right-back. 
Known for his defensive qualities and leadership, Puyol is regarded as one of the greatest defenders and captains of all time.[4][5] His abilities and prowess on the field earned him the nickname of "El Tiburón" ("The Shark") by teammates and fans. He was Barcelona's captain from August 2004 until his retirement in 2014, and appeared in 593 competitive matches for the club. He won 18 major club titles, including six La Liga trophies and three Champions Leagues.
Puyol won 100 caps for Spain, and was part of the squads that won Euro 2008 and the 2010 World Cup. In the 2010 World Cup semi-final, he scored the only goal of the game against Germany.[6]


Club career[edit]
Born in La Pobla de Segur, Lleida, Catalonia,[7] Puyol started playing football for his hometown club as a goalkeeper, but after injury problems with his shoulder, he became a forward. He said that in his youth, "My parents were skeptical about me becoming a footballer and encouraged me to study".[8] In 1995, he joined FC Barcelona's youth system at La Masia, switching positions again to play as a defensive midfielder. Two years later, he started playing for the club's B-team, occupying the position of right-back.[9]
In 1998, Barcelona accepted an offer from Málaga to sell Puyol, who was behind Frank de Boer and Michael Reiziger in the pecking order. However, he refused to leave after seeing his best friend Xavi make his first-team debut.[10]
Louis van Gaal promoted Puyol to the first team the following year, and he made his La Liga debut on 2 October 1999 in a 2–0 away win against Real Valladolid. After that he successfully made another conversion, to central defender. During the 2003 off-season, as Barcelona was immersed in a financial crisis, Manchester United showed interest in signing Puyol,[11] but no move ever materialised. Two years later, he extended his contract for a further five seasons.[12]

Puyol was named club captain at the end of 2003–04, after the retirement of Luis Enrique. He continued to be a defensive cornerstone for Barça, being awarded the "Best European right-back" award by UEFA in 2002 (amongst other individual accolades), and helped the Catalans win two consecutive league titles. In 2005–06 he appeared in a total of 52 games, including 12 in that season's UEFA Champions League which ended in victory against Arsenal, the club's second European Cup.[13]
On 16 September 2008, Puyol made his 400th appearance for Barcelona in a Champions League group stage match against Sporting CP.[14] In the league season, despite injury problems, he appeared in 28 matches and helped them win another league title. His only goal came against Real Madrid in El Clásico at the Santiago Bernabéu on 2 May 2009 which finished with a resounding 6–2 win,[15] and he celebrated his goal by kissing his Catalan flag armband in front of the incensed Madrid fans.[16] He was essential to the team also winning the 2009 Copa del Rey, the 2009 Champions League, the 2009 UEFA Super Cup and the 2009 FIFA Club World Cup to complete an unprecedented sextuple, appearing in nearly 100 official matches.[8][17]

On 13 November 2010, Puyol played his 500th game in all competitions for Barcelona in a domestic league match against Villarreal.[18] He struggled again with injuries during the 2010–11 campaign,[19][20][21] but still appeared in 28 matches, again winning the league and the Champions League. He played the final six minutes in the Champions League final, a 3–1 victory over Manchester United at the Wembley Stadium.[22]
After the defeat to Inter Milan in the 2009–10 Champions League semi-final, Puyol played in 56 matches for Barcelona without losing, a run that only ended on 11 January 2012 at Osasuna (2–3 loss).[23] He also scored two goals in the season's Copa del Rey, against Real Madrid and Valencia.[24][25]

On 2 October 2012, in the late stages of a Champions League group stage encounter at Benfica, his first game upon recovering from a knee ligament injury suffered against Getafe, Puyol dislocated his elbow after landing awkwardly in a corner kick challenge. He was initially expected to be sidelined for two months[26] but fully recovered in one.[27] On 18 December Barcelona renewed his contract, extending it until 30 June 2016.[28] In June of the following year he again underwent surgery on his right knee, his sixth operation as a professional,[29] which led to thoughts of early retirement.[30] Puyol playing for Barcelona in 2011
On 2 March 2014, Puyol surpassed Migueli to go second in Barça's all-time league appearances table, behind only Xavi, and scored the third goal in a 4–1 home win against Almería.[31] Two days later, although he still had two more years in his contract, he announced that he would leave Barcelona at the end of the season.[32] He said "After my last two major operations, I find it is taking me a lot of effort to reach the level required here, even more than myself and the surgeons thought necessary. That's the reason I have reached this decision".[33]
Barcelona bid farewell to Puyol on 15 May 2014, after a fifteen-year career in the first team (ten as captain) that brought him 21 titles. At a packed Auditori 1899, his teammates, ex-teammates, presidents and coaches paid tribute to him, and he said "I’ve lived the dream of so many young kids, doing what I most enjoy in life, playing football and training".[34] He announced his retirement shortly after at the age of 36 but stayed with his only club; he was immediately appointed director of football Andoni Zubizarreta's assistant.[35] He resigned in January 2015, shortly after Zubizarreta was fired.[36]
In September 2019, Puyol rejected an offer to become Barcelona's sporting director.[37]

International career[edit]

Puyol won his first cap for Spain on 15 November 2000 against the Netherlands,[38] and remained a regular fixture in the following years. He played for his country at the 2000 Olympics, 2002 World Cup, Euro 2004,[39] 2006 World Cup, Euro 2008, 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2010 World Cup.[40]
During the 2002 World Cup, Puyol scored an own goal in the 3–1 win over Paraguay in the group stages.[41] In the round of 16 tie against Ireland, he assisted Fernando Morientes; following a 1–1 deadlock after extra-time, his team prevailed following a 3–2 penalty shoot-out victory.[42] Spain were eliminated in the quarter-finals of the competition by co-hosts South Korea, after a 5–3 shoot-out defeat.[43]
Puyol started every game except one at Euro 2008, and Spain's defence only conceded two goals in his five games. They won the final against Germany, and he was named in the Team of the Tournament alongside his defensive partner, Carlos Marchena of Valencia.[44] He started in three out of five matches at the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup, and acted as captain when Iker Casillas was rested for the last group stage fixture;[45] they finished third, and he was included in the Team of the Tournament with four of his teammates.[46]
In the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Puyol started every match and played almost every minute (he was replaced by Marchena in the 84th minute of the quarter-final against Paraguay).[47] He scored the only goal in the semi-final with Germany, a powerful header from a corner taken by Barcelona teammate Xavi, which sent the national team through to their first World Cup final.[48] In the final, he featured for the full 120 minutes as the side defeated the Netherlands 1–0 in extra time.[49] Spain only conceded two goals throughout the tournament – none of which came in the knock-out stages – also keeping five clean sheets, a record for a World Cup–winning team, shared with the 2006 Italy side and 1998's France. He also completed 88% of his passes, the third–highest completion rate of any player in the competition alongside his teammate Sergio Busquets, and was named to the team of the tournament for his performances.[50][51]
On 1 August 2010, aged 32, Puyol announced that he would continue to represent the national team for at least another two years.[52] He missed Spain's victorious Euro 2012 campaign due to a knee injury sustained in a league game against Espanyol in early May, which required surgery and five to six weeks' recuperation.[53] The following year, he was ruled out of the Confederations Cup, once again due to physical problems.[54]
Puyol played his 100th and final international on 6 February 2013, captaining Spain to a 3–1 friendly win over Uruguay in Doha, Qatar.[55][56]

Style of play[edit]


"Puyol is the key, not just because he is one of the best defenders in the world but because of his character. He never lets up."


 —Xavi[57]

Puyol is regarded as one of the best defenders and captains of all time.[4][5] Mainly a central defender, he was a versatile player who could also feature on either flank, mostly as a right-back, in particular in the first part of his career.[58][59][60] He also initially played as a defensive midfielder in his early career,[61] and had previously even been deployed as goalkeeper and striker in his youth.[62][63]
Described as a "no–nonsense" player,[61] Puyol was known for his commanding presence in the air despite his modest stature, as well as his ability to read the game, and his intense commitment and ruggedness as a defender, in particular when challenging for the ball. According to Barcelona's head doctor, he was "the strongest, who has the quickest reactions, and who has the most explosive strength".[10][59][64][65] In 2006, Simon Talbot of The Guardian described Puyol as: "Barcelona's very own Captain Caveman, playing football with his heart on his sleeve and his hair in his eyes, throwing himself about the pitch and launching wholeheartedly into kamikaze tackles like a hyperactive, lunatic kid."[64] Club fans referred to him as "The Wall".[66]
Puyol was also known for his leadership and work ethic. He often continued training alone after the end of a team practice session or on days off.[57] He said in 2010, "I don't have Romário's technique, [Marc] Overmars' pace or [Patrick] Kluivert's strength. But I work harder than the others. I'm like the student who is not as clever, but revises for his exams and does OK in the end."[10] Although his positioning, leadership and ability to organise his defence were initially cited as weaknesses early on in his career, he worked to improve on these aspects of his game throughout his time with Barcelona.[57][67] Indeed, Miguel Ángel Nadal, who played with him for a short period of time, later said, "Carles plays with maturity, has great positional sense, and above all, has pride in his shirt".[10] A physical yet fair player, he was also known for his anticipation, strength, aggression, determination, discipline, intelligence and concentration as a defender, as well as his man-marking skills and ability to organise his defence; he also excelled in one on one situations.[61][67][68][69][70][71][72]
Fellow defender Gerard Piqué said: "He's someone who, even if you're winning 3–0 and there's a few seconds left in the game will shout at the top of his voice at you if he thinks your concentration is going."[69] A former team-mate said, "Even four goals down he thinks we can still win",[57] and another described him as "a pain in the arse", but added "that's exactly what we need".[57][59][73]
Although Puyol was predominantly known for his defensive skills, and albeit not being as talented or naturally gifted as other players who also came out of Barcelona's youth system,[10][59][68][69] he possessed solid technique, and was also known for his composure on the ball as well as his passing ability, despite tending to favour safer or simpler passes rather than riskier ones when playing out from the back.[63][74][75][76][77] As such, throughout his career, he was often deployed alongside a ball-playing centre-back such as Piqué; together, they formed an effective central-defensive partnership, both with Barcelona and Spain, with the former's physical defending complementing the latter's more elegant playing style.[69][78][79][80]
In his youth, Puyol was also known to be a quick and energetic right-sided defender, who had a penchant for getting forward as well as chasing down his opponents;[65][68][69][81] however, he lost his pace with age.[68][82] This became particularly noticeable in his later career, when he was usually deployed in the centre, in part due to a series of recurring knee injuries, which limited his playing time and affected his physical condition, eventually forcing him to retire prematurely.[59][83][84][85][86][87][88]

Personal life[edit]

Puyol's long shaggy hair was a distinctive feature throughout his career. Barcelona manager Van Gaal suggested he get it cut when the player was 19, immediately after his first training session with the senior players. Van Gaal asked him in his office, "What's your problem, can't you afford the money for a haircut?". Puyol recalled: "I said nothing, and to this day have kept my hair as it is."[10][89]
In 2006, Puyol said that when not working, he leads "a very quiet life... I've not been to a nightclub in Barcelona for years either. When I go out, I stay in a restaurant with my friends."[8]
Puyol's father, Josep, died in a farming accident in late 2006 while Carles was on his way to play a match against Deportivo de La Coruña. He was informed of the news by coach Frank Rijkaard upon landing.[90] He said that this, combined with an injury led to a dark period, with Spain national team physio Raúl Martínez eventually coming to Barcelona: in the player's words, "...[he] gave me a great telling off. He made me react, and I began to try to be more cheerful, and not overwhelmed by it all."[91]
In March 2009, Puyol told Goal.com: "I do not like to go out much, although it is good to disconnect and I like to read."[92] In September 2010, he started a relationship with model Malena Costa. In October of that year, he scored through a header in a 2–1 home win against Valencia CF and dedicated the goal to her by making a heart symbol with both hands. After the game, he said: "I dedicate the goal to my girlfriend."[93]
In 2011, Puyol paid €30,000 for specialist private treatment for Miki Roqué, a footballer from his home province who was suffering from pelvic cancer. Roqué died in 2012.[94]
Puyol started a relationship with Vanesa Lorenzo in 2012. The couple has two daughters, Manuela (born 2014) and María (2016).[95][96]
Puyol was invited by Iranian television channel IRIB TV3 to provide commentary on the 2018 FIFA World Cup match between Iran and Spain on 20 June in a programme hosted by Adel Ferdosipour but was not allowed in the studio. According to news website Entekhab, the former player said that he had been told by the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting that he could not appear in the programme "because of his looks (long hair)"; the veteran channel director had been replaced by one closer to Iran's ultra-religious hardliners weeks before, and this incident ultimately led to some ridicule within Iran on Twitter.[97]

*Club domestic league appearances and goals
Xavier Hernández Creus[a] (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈʃaβjeɾ eɾˈnandeθ];[3] born 25 January 1980), also known as Xavi Hernández ([ˈʃaβj eɾˈnandeθ]) or simply Xavi ([ˈʃaβi]), is a Spanish professional football manager and former player who manages La Liga club Barcelona. Widely considered one of the greatest midfielders of all time,[4][5] Xavi was renowned for his passing, vision, ball retention, and positioning.[6][7][8][9] He won 32 trophies in his career, making him the second-most decorated Spanish player in history, behind former teammate Andrés Iniesta.[10][11][12]
He was included in the FIFA FIFPro World XI on six occasions: 2008 to 2013, and the UEFA Team of the Year five times: 2008 to 2012. In 2020 Xavi was named in the Ballon d'Or Dream Team, a greatest all-time XI published by France Football.[13] He is one of the few recorded players to have made over 1,000 professional career appearances.
Xavi joined La Masia, the Barcelona youth academy at age 11 and made his first-team debut against Mallorca in August 1998, age 18. In all, he played 767 official matches, a former club record—now held by Lionel Messi—and scored 85 goals.[14] Xavi is the first player in the club's history to play 150 European and FIFA Club World Cup matches combined.[15] With Barcelona, Xavi won eight La Liga titles and four UEFA Champions League titles. In 2015, he departed Barcelona for Al Sadd, where he won four trophies before retiring in 2019.
With Spain, Xavi won the FIFA World Youth Championship in 1999, and the Olympic silver medal at the 2000 Olympics. After making his senior team debut in 2000, he was capped 133 times for his country, and was an influential figure in the team's successes. He played an integral role in Spain's victory at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, as well as their wins at UEFA Euro 2008 and UEFA Euro 2012. He was named Player of the Tournament at UEFA Euro 2008,[16] and was named in the UEFA Euro Team of the Tournament in 2008 and 2012. With two assists in the UEFA Euro 2012 Final, Xavi became the first player to register assists in two separate European finals, after setting up the only goal in the final four years earlier.[17] After the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Xavi announced his retirement from international football.[18]
Xavi came third in the 2009 FIFA World Player of the Year, followed by third place for its successor award, the FIFA Ballon d'Or, in 2010 and 2011. In 2011, he was runner up to Messi for the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award. Xavi was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award in 2012. He was awarded the IFFHS World's Best Playmaker award four times, all straight between 2008 and 2011.
After retirement, Xavi transitioned to coaching, and he was named the manager at Qatar Stars League club Al Sadd in May 2019, where he won seven titles in less than three years. In November 2021, Xavi was appointed as manager at his former club Barcelona. He won the 2022–23 Supercopa de España & the 2022–23 La Liga title in his first full season as the club's manager.


Early life[edit]


"I've been lucky enough to be brought up on the Barcelona ethos. Which has taught me the value of being part of a team. 'Today for you, tomorrow for me.' Those qualities are essential for life in general."


—Xavi on learning the team ethos of Barcelona while at the club's youth system, La Masia.[19]

Born in Terrassa, Barcelona, Catalonia,[20] Xavi is a product of FC Barcelona's La Masia youth system, which he joined at the age of 11 from UFB Jàbac Terrassa and Terrassa FC. His father, Joaquim, was a former player for Sabadell in the first division.[21] His older brother, Óscar, is a former player and manager.[22] Xavi made his way through the youth and reserve teams and was a key member of Josep Maria Gonzalvo's Barcelona B team that won promotion to the Second Division.
Although he was initially inspired by compatriot playmaker Pep Guardiola at Barcelona,[23] as a child Xavi also watched a lot of English football, and looked up to midfielders John Barnes, Paul Gascoigne and Matt Le Tissier.[24]

Club career[edit]
Barcelona[edit]
1998–2001: Beginnings[edit]
Xavi's progression through the teams earned him a first-team appearance in a Copa Catalunya match against Lleida on 5 May 1998[25] and he scored his first goal on 18 August 1998 in the 1998 Supercopa de España against Mallorca. His debut in La Liga came against Valencia on 3 October 1998 in a 3–1 victory for Barcelona. Initially featuring intermittently both for the reserve and senior teams, Xavi scored the only goal in a 1–0 victory over Real Valladolid when Barcelona were in tenth position in the league. Sustained impressive performances meant that he became a key member of Louis van Gaal's title-winning team, finishing his debut season with 26 matches played and being named 1999 La Liga Breakthrough Player of the Year. Xavi became Barcelona's principal playmaker after an injury to Pep Guardiola in the 1999–2000 season.[26][27]

2001–2008: Breakthrough and vice-captaincy[edit]

In these years, Barcelona was on the verge of bankruptcy and struggling to keep its place in La Liga's elite. Playing midfield, but in a more defensive role, Xavi made 20 assists and scored 7 goals in those two seasons. On 16 March 2002, he scored his first goal in El Clásico against Real Madrid.[28]
Xavi was named the vice-captain in the 2004–05 season, in which he helped Barcelona win La Liga and the 2004 Supercopa de España.[29] He was named La Liga Spanish Player of the Year in 2005.[29]
In the 2005–06 season, Xavi tore the ligaments in his left knee in training; he was out of action for four months but returned in April and was on the substitutes bench for Barcelona's win in the 2006 Champions League Final against Arsenal. He also won La Liga and the Supercopa de España again.[29]

2008–2012: Sustained domestic and European success[edit]


"Xavi is a player who has the Barcelona DNA: someone who has the taste for good football, someone who is humble and someone who has loyalty to this club. From the first moment I saw him play, I knew he would become the brain behind Barcelona for many years to come."


—Former Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola, September 2008.[30]

After being named Player of the Tournament at Euro 2008, Xavi spoke to Bayern Munich about a transfer, but newly appointed Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola convinced him that he was too important to the club to be allowed to leave.[31] He was a main part of Barcelona's treble and scored the fourth goal in the 4–1 win in the 2009 Copa del Rey Final against Athletic Bilbao, with a free kick. In La Liga, one of his most significant games was the 6–2 Clásico victory over Real Madrid on 2 May; he assisted four goals – once to Carles Puyol, once to Thierry Henry and twice to Lionel Messi.[32]
Xavi helped Barcelona win the 2009 Champions League Final 2–0 against Manchester United, assisting the second goal by crossing to Messi for his header.[33] Prior to the match, Manchester United coach Sir Alex Ferguson heaped praise on the central midfield combination of Xavi and Andrés Iniesta, stating, "I don't think Xavi and Iniesta have ever given the ball away in their lives. They get you on that carousel and they can leave you dizzy."[34] Xavi was voted "UEFA Champions League best midfielder" for his contribution during Barcelona's victorious 2008–09 Champions League campaign.[35] Xavi was the highest assisting player in La Liga with 20,[36] and in the Champions League, with 7; he earned 29 assists overall that season. Xavi was under contract to Barça until 2014 after extending his contract during the 2008–09 season.[37] The new contract made him one of the club's biggest earners, with a salary of €7.5 million a year.[37]

Xavi in action for Barcelona in 2008
During the 2009–10 season, journalists increasingly noted Xavi's contribution to the Barcelona team. For example:

"Quite simply the best midfielder of modern football. It could even be argued that Xavi and Matthäus are the two best in this position in history. World class for several years now, it is the past three seasons in particular where the 30-year-old has been untouchable. Xavi's passing is up there with Michel Platini, he creates countless goals with genius through balls while virtually never relinquishing possession."[38]
In the 2009–10 season, Xavi again topped the assists table and provided both the assists in Barcelona's 2–0 victory against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu. Barcelona won the Liga title with a record 99 points, and Xavi was acclaimed Barcelona's second-best player in a season-long vote.[39] On 3 June 2010, Madrid-based newspaper Marca awarded him third place in the annual Trofeo Alfredo di Stéfano award for the best player in La Liga, behind Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.[40]



"Our model was imposed by [Johan] Cruyff; it's an Ajax model. It's all about rondos [piggy in the middle]. Rondo, rondo, rondo"


—Xavi speaking in 2011 about the tiki-taka passing style introduced to Barcelona by Johan Cruyff.[41]

On 9 June 2010, Xavi signed a new four-year contract with the club, which could be automatically renewed up to 30 June 2016 based on number of games played.[42] On 29 November, he scored his third goal against arch-rivals Real Madrid in a 5–0 home win. On 18 December, he scored another goal against Espanyol in a 5–1 win. In the Champions League, Xavi scored a valuable goal with an assist from David Villa in a home win against Arsenal, that saw Barcelona progress to the quarter-finals.[43]
Xavi was one of the three finalists for the 2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or, and finished third in the vote behind his Barcelona teammates Lionel Messi and Andrés Iniesta.[44][45] He narrowly defeated Messi to win the Player of the Year award from World Soccer magazine.[46]

On 2 January 2011, in a league match against Levante, Xavi made his 549th appearance for the club in all competitions, matching the record held by Migueli. Xavi later became the player with the most appearances for Barcelona of all time.[47] On 28 May, Xavi was imperious in the 2011 UEFA Champions League Final at Wembley Stadium in London as Barcelona defeated Manchester United in the showpiece for the second time in three seasons, winning 3–1.[29]
Xavi began the 2011–12 season in fine goalscoring form and seemed to grow in his influence of the team despite the long-anticipated return of Cesc Fàbregas and the promotion of Thiago to create added competition for places in Barça's attacking midfield positions. On 18 December, in the 2011 FIFA Club World Cup Final in Yokohama, Barcelona won 4–0 against Brazilian side Santos as Xavi scored a goal and made an assist to Lionel Messi.[48] After the ball was slightly behind him, Xavi brought the ball down with a cocked leg, effectively using his ankle to control it, before slipping a pass through to Messi, who scored the first goal.[48]
Xavi scored the winning goal in the Group H game against A.C. Milan, a vital match for Barcelona's progression in the Champions League knockout stage. In total, Xavi had the best goalscoring return of his career in 2011–12 season with ten Liga goals, two in the Copa del Rey – which Barcelona won – and one in the Club World Cup final win.[29]

2012–2015: Later years and departure[edit]
Xavi as Barcelona captain in November 2012
On 18 December 2012, Barcelona renewed Xavi's contract, extending it until 30 June 2016.[49]
He scored a goal against Real Madrid in a 3–2 win for Barcelona. Xavi was named in the FIFA World XI, along with teammates Iniesta, Messi and Dani Alves.[50] Barcelona had virtually secured their La Liga title by the start of 2013, eventually equalling Real Madrid's 100-point record of the previous season.[51][52]
On 16 January 2014, Xavi made his 700th appearance for the first team against Getafe in the Copa del Rey.[53] For the first time in five years, Barcelona ended the season without a major trophy; they were defeated in the Copa del Rey Final by Real Madrid with Gareth Bale scoring a late winner, and lost the league in the last game to Atlético Madrid.[54][55]
In June 2014, it was announced that Xavi would be leaving the club.[56][57][58] On 22 July, however, after talks with newly appointed manager and former teammate Luis Enrique, Xavi decided to stay at Camp Nou for one more season.[59] He was also appointed as club captain after Carles Puyol's retirement. On 25 April 2015, Xavi made his 500th La Liga appearance, becoming the eighth player in history to do so.[60] On 4 June, a farewell event was held at Barcelona for Xavi with players, managers, friends and family paying tribute to him.[61][62]
On 6 June 2015, Xavi came on as a 78th-minute substitute for Andrés Iniesta to make his 767th and final appearance for Barcelona during the 2015 Champions League Final, as the club won its fifth European Cup, beating Juventus at Berlin's Olympiastadion. Xavi, as club captain, lifted the trophy.[14][63] This made Barcelona the first club in history to win the treble of domestic league, domestic cup and European Cup twice.[64] Xavi, Iniesta, Messi, Gerard Piqué, Pedro, Sergio Busquets and Dani Alves were part of both treble-winning teams.[64] Xavi's 767 appearances was a club record until surpassed by Lionel Messi in March 2021.[65]

Al Sadd[edit]

On 21 May 2015, Xavi announced that he would join Qatari club Al Sadd at the end of the 2014–15 season on a three-year contract. According to his agent, the deal would involve him becoming an ambassador for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, and also start his coaching qualifications.[66] He made his debut for Al Sadd in a 4–0 win over Mesaimeer on 13 September 2015, assisting in the team's first goal.[67] In the following match, he scored his first goal for the club in a 2–2 draw with Umm Salal.[68] Al Sadd ended the league campaign in third position putting them in a place for the next season's AFC Champions League, the elite club competition of the Asian Football Confederation. Xavi scored three goals during the season. In the Champions League, Al Sadd were knocked out from the qualifying rounds by Emirati side Al Jazira on penalties; Xavi missed his spot kick.[69]
Xavi won his first trophy with Al Sadd following a 2–1 victory over El Jaish in the Qatar Cup final on 29 April 2017.[70] On 10 November 2017, Xavi said that he would retire when his contract with Al Sadd expired at the end of the 2017–18 season, and would later pursue a coaching career.[71] However, he postponed these plans and signed a two-year contract extension on 24 May 2018.[72] In October 2018, Al Sadd reached the 2018 AFC Champions League semi-finals of the tournament with Xavi as captain but were eliminated 2–1 by Persepolis.[73]
On 2 May 2019, Xavi announced that he would be retiring from professional football at the end of the season.[74] On 20 May 2019, Xavi played the final match of his career, a 2–0 defeat to Persepolis in Tehran, Iran which was Al Sadd's final AFC Champions League group match; before the match, he stated that he would like to remain in Qatar after his retirement, and that he would look to begin a coaching career, commenting: "The idea is to start as a coach in Qatar, to test myself and get some experience."[75]

International career[edit]
Xavi playing for Spain
Xavi played for Spain at the 2000 Olympics, 2002 World Cup, Euro 2004, 2006 World Cup, Euro 2008, 2009 Confederations Cup, 2010 World Cup, Euro 2012, 2013 Confederations Cup and the 2014 World Cup. In 1999 he was part of the Spanish team that won FIFA World Youth Championship in Nigeria, with Xavi also scoring two goals in the tournament.[76]

UEFA Euro 2008[edit]
Xavi was named Euro 2008's player of the tournament after Spain defeated Germany 1–0 in the final.[77] Xavi was dominant in midfield, where his passing and reading of the game was pivotal to Spain's success, as he led his nation to their first silverware since the 1964 European Championship.[77] Andy Roxburgh, head of UEFA's technical committee, said, "We have chosen Xavi because he epitomizes the Spanish style of play. He was influential in the whole possession, passing and penetrating kind of game that Spain played."[16]
Xavi scored the first goal in the semi-final against Russia, which Spain won 3–0.[78] In the final, he made the pass from which Fernando Torres scored the winning goal.[79]

2010 World Cup[edit]
Xavi at the 2010 FIFA World Cup
Xavi was named in Spain's squad for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, with Spain eventually winning their first World Cup.[80] He provided the most accurate passes, 599 with a passing success rate of 91%, and he crossed the ball inside the 18-yard box more than any other player in the tournament. In the final he made 57 accurate forward half passes.[81] Xavi also covered 80.20 kilometres throughout the competitions, averaging approximately 11.5 kilometres per game,[82] more than any other player.[83] In the final, he covered a distance of almost 15 kilometres.[84]

Xavi is the beating heart of this Spanish team, the man dictating the tiki-taka pulse of pass after pass. He may be just 5ft 7in with a curiously hunched gait but no player more influences the way his whole team plays. He doesn't score, doesn't really tackle: he just passes and passes with a precision and wit unmatched by any of his peers.— Duncan White of The Telegraph on Xavi at the 2010 World Cup.[85]
During the round of 16 match against Portugal, Xavi provided a backheel pass in the 63rd minute to David Villa. Although Villa had his shot with his left foot blocked by goalkeeper Eduardo, he then put in the rebound with his right foot for the winning goal.[86] In the semi-final against Germany, Xavi crossed from a corner to the edge of the six-yard box, where Carles Puyol scored with a header into the top-right corner.[87] Spain dominated possession throughout the competition, averaging 59% possession during their three group matches, and 44 passes per shot throughout the entire World Cup, in large part thanks to midfield trio of Xavi, Iniesta, and Xabi Alonso, who were singled out in the media for their role in Spain's title–run; Spain also completed more passes (3,547) than any World Cup team since 1966.[77][88]

UEFA Euro 2012[edit]
Xavi (left) turns away from Italy's Riccardo Montolivo in the Euro 2012 final.
Xavi played for Spain at Euro 2012 which Spain won by defeating Italy 4–0 in the final. Xavi attempted 136 passes (127 completed, 94% success rate) during Spain's 4–0 victory in the group stage match against the Republic of Ireland, more than any other player in a European Championship match. The previous record of 117 had been set by Ronald Koeman in a Euro 1992 match between the Netherlands and Denmark. Xavi and Andrés Iniesta made 229 passes in the match, more than the combined Irish team managed. "Pum, pum, pum, pum" was how Xavi described the rhythmic sound of the ball moving between himself and his midfield partner.[89]
With Xavi providing two assists in the final, for Jordi Alba and Fernando Torres, he became the first player to register assists in two European Championship finals.[17] Spain's UEFA Euro 2012 victory made Xavi the most decorated player in Spanish football history, a status that he previously shared with Carles Puyol, who missed the tournament.[17]

Retirement[edit]
On 5 August 2014, following the 2014 World Cup where Spain were eliminated at the group stage, Xavi announced his retirement from international football, having made 133 appearances in a 14-year period.[90][91] Spain's World Cup-winning manager Vicente del Bosque paid tribute, stating that Xavi was "a key part of the team's style of play" and "he was more important to us than even the manager", also adding, "We will miss him both on and off the pitch. He is a player who we hold in great esteem both personally and as a player. He is and always will be a person and a player who is greatly valued by the federation, the coaching staff and by myself."[92]

Managerial career[edit]
Al Sadd[edit]
Xavi managing Al Sadd in an AFC Champions League match against Sepahan, 18 February 2020
On 28 May 2019 it was announced that Xavi would take over as manager of Al Sadd on a two-year contract.[93][94] Xavi helped the club reach the semi-finals of the AFC Champions League, where they were eliminated by Al-Hilal FC 6–5 on aggregate.[95] In the league, the club finished third. In the 2019–20 season, Xavi led his team to win one domestic trophy, the Qatar Cup. In the 2020 AFC Champions League, Al Sadd reached the round of 16 but were eliminated 1–0 by Persepolis.[96][73] During his 97 games in charge of Al Sadd, spanning two and a half years, he led the club to seven trophies.[97]
On 3 November 2021, Al Sadd drew 3–3 against Al-Duhail in his final game in-charge. Two days later Al Sadd announced Xavi's move to Barcelona after his release clause was paid.[98]

Barcelona[edit]
On 6 November 2021, Xavi returned to his former club Barcelona as the new manager replacing Ronald Koeman, on a contract until June 2024.[99] Following his arrival, Xavi implemented stricter rules for the players which included re-introduction of fines, early arrival for training and tracking of players' off pitch activities.[100][101][102]
In his first game in charge, Barcelona defeated local rival Espanyol by a 1–0 scoreline at the Camp Nou in La Liga to win his first Catalan Derby as manager.[103] On 4 December, Xavi suffered his first defeat as Barcelona manager after losing 1–0 to Real Betis at home in La Liga.[104] In Xavi's first Champions League campaign, he took charge with two group stage matches remaining. After drawing 0–0 with Benfica at the Camp Nou on 23 November and losing 3–0 to Bayern Munich on 8 December at the Allianz Arena, Barcelona finished third in the group stage which put them in the Europa League knockout round play-offs.[105][106]
On 12 January 2022, in his first Clásico in charge, Barcelona were beaten by Real Madrid 2–3 at the end of extra-time in the Supercopa de España semi-final.[107] Barcelona suffered an early exit from the Copa del Rey after being beaten by Athletic Bilbao 3–2 at the end of extra-time in the round of 16.[108] In the winter transfer window, Barcelona strengthened their attack with the signings of Ferran Torres and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Adama Traoré on loan. After a difficult first few months for Xavi, Barcelona quickly turned around their form with the new signings playing a big role in the process. The team entered a 14-match unbeaten streak starting with a 0–1 victory over Alavés in La Liga, during this run they scored four goals in 6 out of 11 matches and also qualified for the quarter-finals of the Europa League. On 20 March, Xavi won his first Clásico as manager beating Real Madrid 0–4 in La Liga at the Santiago Bernabéu ending their five-match Clásico losing streak and extending their unbeaten run to 12 matches.[109][110] On 14 April, Xavi and his men who were on the verge of a monumental comeback, were knocked out of the UEL quarter-finals by Eintracht Frankfurt, bringing their fifteen-game unbeaten run to an end.[111] In La Liga, he led Barcelona to a second-placed finish from ninth position when he took charge.[112][113]
In the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League, Barcelona finished third in their group behind Bayern Munich and Inter Milan to drop to the Europa League for the second consecutive season.[114] On 15 January 2023, Barcelona won their first title under Xavi, following a 3–1 victory against Real Madrid in the Supercopa de España Final.[115] On 14 May 2023, Barcelona clinched the 2022–23 La Liga title after defeating rivals Espanyol 4–2, with Xavi leading the club to its first league title since the 2018–19 season.[116] On 22 September 2023, it was announced that he extended his contract at the club until 2025.[117]
A string of disappointing results across December and January, including 4–1 and 4–2 cup losses to Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao respectively, led to increased pressure and scrutiny on Xavi.[118] Following a 3–5 home loss to Villarreal on 27 January, leaving the club 10 points behind league leaders Real Madrid, he announced that he would leave the club after the conclusion of the season.[119]

Style of play[edit]
Xavi would often evade players with a 360 degree turn (la pelopina), before finding a teammate with a pinpoint pass.
Xavi is widely considered one of the best midfielders of all time,[6][7][120][121] relying largely on his ability to find and exploit space as a deep-lying playmaker. As he said, "That's what I do: look for spaces. All day. I'm always looking."[122][123] Finding space, he would appear for a teammate to receive and then move the ball on, with his coach Pep Guardiola putting it: "I get the ball, I give the ball, I get the ball, I give the ball."[124] A diminutive, composed, agile, and technically skilled player with a slender physique and a low centre of gravity, these characteristics compensated for his lack of pace or physicality.[85][88][125] Xavi's signature move when in possession involved him performing a 360 degree turn, a feint known as la pelopina, that allowed him to move away from the opposing player, retain possession, and gave him space and time on the ball to think about his next pass.[126] In his youth, he had also played as a centre-back, before being shifted to a midfield role.[88] While primarily a central midfielder with Barcelona,[127] he often played in a more advanced midfield role with Spain.[128]



"I think I haven't changed at all to what I am now. I've been a passer since a young age. I liked passing with the rest of the players and my friends when we played football on the streets, in the main square, and at school. I think I was very similar to what people see in the stadium."


Xavi on his own style of play, November 2014.[24]

Although he was not known for his tackling ability, or for being prolific in front of goal,[85] Xavi's outstanding vision, "metronomic" pinpoint accurate passing,[129] excellent off the ball movement, superb reading of the game, positional sense, and world-class ball control allowed him to create chances for teammates and dictate the flow of play in midfield, while rarely relinquishing possession.[130][131] These qualities were displayed by his performance during Spain's 2010 World Cup victory, where he maintained a 91% passing success rate throughout the entire tournament, in addition to providing two assists, while Spain dominated possession throughout the competition.[132][133][134][135]
Xavi's ability to control games earned him the sobriquet, The Puppet Master.[129][136] Jorge Valdano opined, "If football was a science, Xavi would have discovered the formula. With a ball at his feet, no one else has ever communicated so intelligently with every player on the pitch."[97] Barcelona president Sandro Rosell believed that Xavi, together with Lionel Messi, Andrés Iniesta and Sergio Busquets, perfected the club's tiki-taka style of play, a style introduced to the club by former coach Johan Cruyff.[137] Despite primarily being a creative player, however, he was also capable of scoring goals himself in addition to assisting them.[34] Named in the Ballon d'Or Dream Team, a greatest all-time XI, Xavi's creativity, range of passing, and unique set of skills have led many in the sport to regard him as one of the greatest passers[138] and one of the finest playmakers in history.[124][139] In addition to his playing ability, Xavi was also praised for his leadership.[140][141]

Style of management[edit]
Upon transitioning into management, Xavi continues to hold coaching principles and style of play consistent with the Barcelona style popularized by Johan Cruyff and influenced by his playing career under Pep Guardiola.[citation needed]
When describing his man-management philosophy, Xavi explained that "The matter of managing a dressing room is almost more important than the tactical matter. At the end of the day we become half coaches, half psychologists. Being an elite footballer made more empathetic to the players who don't play as much and I also know what the growth of a footballer feels like, and who needs a more loving approach. This gives me a sense of control over the dressing room." Xavi cites about his coaching influences in an interview revealing as follows: "Having a lot of coaches in my career made me take a little bit from all of them: from Van Gaal, from Rijkaard, from Guardiola, from Luis Enrique, from Iñaki Sáez, from Luis Aragonés. I got my masters in man-management from Aragonés and my masters in tactics from Guardiola."[142]

Media[edit]
Xavi has a sponsorship deal with German sportswear and equipment supplier Adidas and has appeared in Adidas commercials alongside Lionel Messi, Luis Suárez and Robin van Persie.[143] Xavi has worn Adidas Predator boots.[144]
In November 2014, Xavi appeared in FIFA's "11 against Ebola" campaign with a selection of top football players from around the world, including Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar, Gareth Bale and Didier Drogba.[145] Under the slogan "Together, we can beat Ebola", FIFA's campaign was done in conjunction with the Confederation of African Football (CAF) and health experts, with the players holding up 11 messages to raise awareness of the disease and ways to combat it.[145][146]

Personal life[edit]
Since July 2013, Xavi has been married to Núria Cunillera. They have a daughter, Asia, born in 2016 and a son, Dan, born in 2018.[147][148]

*Club domestic league appearances and goals
Josep "Pep" Guardiola Sala (Catalan pronunciation: [ˈpɛb ɡwəɾðiˈɔlə];[3][4][5] born 18 January 1971) is a Spanish professional football manager and former player who is currently the manager of Premier League club Manchester City. Guardiola is the only manager to win the continental treble twice, the youngest to win the UEFA Champions League, and he also holds the records for the most consecutive league games won in La Liga, the Bundesliga and the Premier League.[a] He is considered to be one of the greatest managers of all time.[7][8][9]
Guardiola was a defensive midfielder who usually played in a deep-lying playmaker's role. He spent the majority of his career with Barcelona, forming a part of Johan Cruyff's Dream Team that won the club's first European Cup in 1992, and four successive Spanish league titles from 1991 to 1994. He captained the team from 1997 until his departure from Barcelona in 2001. Guardiola then had stints with Brescia and Roma in Italy, Al-Ahli in Qatar and Dorados in Mexico. He was capped 47 times for the Spanish national team and appeared at the 1994 FIFA World Cup, as well as at UEFA Euro 2000. He also played friendly matches for Catalonia.
After retiring as a player, Guardiola briefly managed Barcelona B, with whom he won a Tercera División title. He took charge of the first team in 2008. In his first season, he led Barcelona to the continental treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League, becoming the youngest manager to win the latter competition. He was named the FIFA World Coach of the Year in 2011 after leading the club to another La Liga and Champions League double in the 2010–11 season. Guardiola ended his four-year Barcelona stint in 2012 with 14 honours, a club record.
After a sabbatical period, Guardiola joined Bayern Munich in 2013 and won the Bundesliga in each of the three seasons, including two domestic doubles. He left the club for Manchester City in 2016 and guided them to the Premier League title in his second season in charge, breaking numerous domestic records, as the team became the first to attain 100 points in a single season. He led City to a domestic treble in 2018–19, their first Champions League final in 2020–21, and their first Champions League title as part of another continental treble in 2022–23.


Club career
1988–2001: Barcelona
Born in Santpedor, Barcelona, Catalonia, Guardiola joined La Masia at age 13 from Gimnàstic de Manresa and rose through the ranks of Barcelona's youth academy for six years, making his debut in 1990 against Cádiz.[10] As Phil Ball writes in Morbo, In his first week at the club, Johan Cruyff turned up unannounced at the Mini Estadi, a venue just down the road from Camp Nou used by Barcelona B. Just before half-time he wandered into the dug-out and asked Charly Rexach, the youth team manager at the time, the name of the young lad playing on the right side of midfield. "Guardiola – good lad," came the reply. Cruyff ignored the comment and told Rexach to move him into the middle for the second half, to play as pivot. It was a difficult position to adapt to and one not used by many teams in Spain at the time. Guardiola adjusted immediately, as Cruyff had suspected he would, and when he moved to the first-team in 1990, he became the pivot of the Dream Team.[11]

Guardiola became a first-team regular in the 1991–92 season, and at only 20 years old was a key component of a side that won La Liga and the European Cup.[12] The Italian magazine Guerin Sportivo heralded Guardiola as the finest player in the world under the age of 21.[13] Cruyff's "Dream Team" went on to retain La Liga title in the 1992–93 and 1993–94 seasons. The side again reached the 1994 UEFA Champions League final, but were beaten 4–0 by Fabio Capello's AC Milan side in Athens. Cruyff left in 1996, with Barcelona finishing fourth in the 1994–95 season and third in the 1995–96 season, but Guardiola retained his position at the centre of Barcelona's midfield.[citation needed]
In the 1996–97 season, Barcelona, this time led by Bobby Robson, won three cups: the Copa del Rey, the Supercopa de España, and the European Cup Winners' Cup. In 1997, Guardiola was named as Barcelona captain under new manager Louis van Gaal, but a calf muscle injury ruled Guardiola out of most of the 1997–98 season, in which Barcelona won a league and cup double. At the end of the season, Barcelona rejected offers from Roma and Parma (of around 300 million pesetas) for Guardiola. After prolonged and complicated contract talks, he signed a new contract with Barcelona that extended his stay until 2001.[citation needed]
Guardiola returned to action the following season and Barcelona once again won La Liga. On 8 June 1998, Guardiola underwent surgery to try to resolve his lingering calf injury, which had caused him to miss the 1998 FIFA World Cup for Spain. A largely disappointing 1999–2000 season again ended in surgery, with Guardiola missing the last three months of the season with a serious ankle injury. 
On 11 April 2001, Barcelona's captain announced his intention to leave the club after 17 years of service. He stated that it was a personal decision and, in part, a response to what he perceived as football heading in a new, more physical, direction. On 24 June 2001, Guardiola played his last match with Barcelona in the final game of the season against Celta Vigo.[14] Guardiola played 479 games in 12 seasons for the first team, winning 16 trophies. At the press conference after the Celta game, he said: "It's been a long journey. I'm happy, proud, happy with the way people treated me and I have made many friends. I cannot ask for more. I have had many years in the elite. I did not come to make history but to make my own history." A number of future Barcelona midfielders, including Xavi, Andrés Iniesta and Cesc Fàbregas, have hailed Guardiola as their role model and hero.[15]

2001–2006: Later career
After leaving Barcelona in 2001 at age 30, Guardiola joined Serie A side Brescia as Andrea Pirlo's replacement in the deep-lying playmaker role, where he played alongside Roberto Baggio under manager Carlo Mazzone.[16] Following his stint at Brescia, Guardiola transferred to Roma. His time in Italy, however, was unsuccessful and included a four-month ban for testing positive for nandrolone (he was cleared of all charges in 2009).[17]
After his career with Brescia and Roma, in 2003, Guardiola played in Qatar with Al-Ahli from Doha in the Qatar Stars League. In 2005–06, he turned down offers from a number of European clubs, as he felt his playing career was coming to a close.[18]
In 2006, Juan Manuel Lillo was appointed the manager of Mexican club Dorados. Lillo recruited Guardiola to play for the club while he was in managing school in Axocopán, Atlixco, Puebla. Guardiola played with Dorados for six months, but was limited to ten appearances due to injuries, before retiring. He scored one goal for the club.[19]

International career
Spain
Guardiola made his senior debut in October 1992; that same year, he captained Spain when they won a gold medal at the Barcelona Olympic Games. That same year he won the Bravo Award, which recognises the world's best player under the age of 21. Between 1992 and 2001, Guardiola played over 47 times and scored five goals for the senior Spain team. He was a member of the Spanish team during the 1994 World Cup, where they reached the quarter-finals, losing 2–1 to Italy. He fell out of favour with Javier Clemente, Spain's manager, due to disagreements and missed out on Euro 1996. He suffered a career-threatening injury in 1998, which kept him out of the 1998 World Cup, but he later played at Euro 2000, where he led Spain to yet another quarter-final, this time losing to France by the same margin, 2–1. He led the Spanish midfield until his final appearance on 14 November 2001, in a 1–0 win in a friendly against Mexico; he scored his last international goal against Sweden in a 1–1 draw during his 45th appearance.[1][20]

Catalonia
Guardiola has played for and advocated on behalf of the Catalonia football team. Between 1995 and 2005, he played seven friendly games for Catalonia.[21]

Player profile
Style of play
Guardiola was a highly creative, hard-working, nimble, and elegant player, with good anticipation, tactical awareness, and an ability to read the game; throughout his career, he was usually deployed as either a central or defensive midfielder in front of his team's back-line,[22][23][24] although he was also capable of playing in more attacking midfield roles.[25] Although he was competent defensively and able to press opponents to break up play and win the ball effectively through his team-work and defensive positioning,[25][26][27] he also had a tendency to give away many fouls; as such, and also in part due to his slender physical build, he usually functioned as a deep-lying playmaker in front of the defence, where he excelled courtesy of his technical ability and intelligent, efficient, precise passing game.[23][25][28][29] Despite his lack of notable pace, dribbling ability, aerial prowess, or strong physical or athletic attributes, Guardiola was highly regarded throughout his career for his vision, close control, passing range, positional sense, and calm composure on the ball, as well as his speed of thought,[25][30] which enabled him to retain possession under pressure and either set the tempo of his team's play in midfield with quick and intricate short first-time exchanges,[25][31][32] or switch the play or create chances with longer passes.[25][32][33][34][35] His role has also been likened to that of a metodista ("centre-half", in Italian football jargon), due to his ability to dictate play in midfield as well as assist his team defensively.[36]
Guardiola was capable of being an offensive threat, due to his ability to make attacking runs[37] or strike accurately from distance; he was also effective at creating chances or shooting on goal from set-pieces. Having served as captain of both Barcelona and the Spanish national side, he also stood out for his leadership throughout his career.[38][39] Despite his playing ability, however, he was also known to be injury prone throughout his career.[25]

Reception
Guardiola's playing style, which relied on creativity, technique and ball movement, rather than physicality and pace, inspired several future diminutive Spanish playmaking midfielders, such as Xavi,[40][41] Andrés Iniesta,[42] and Cesc Fàbregas, with the latter describing him as his "idol".[43] Pirlo instead described Guardiola as the "model" for the position which he himself occupied deep in midfield.[41] Former Barcelona president Joan Laporta once described Guardiola as "the best central midfielder in our history."[44] Johan Cruyff considered him to be one of the best midfielders of his generation,[45] a view echoed by Richard Jolly of FourFourTwo and Marco Frattino, the latter of whom stated in 2018: "Twenty years ago, [...] Pep Guardiola was one of the best midfielders in the world."[46][47] In 2001, his agent Josè Maria Orobitg described him as the best in the world at dictating the tempo and rhythm of his team's play.[32]
Miguel Val of Marca considered Guardiola to be one of the greatest Spanish players of all time, describing him as the "brains of Barcelona's Dream Team under Johan Cruyff" in 2020.[48] Federico Aquè described him as one of the best deep-lying playmakers in European football in his prime,[25] while Lee Bushe of 90min.com even included him in his list of "The Best Deep-Lying Playmakers of All Time" in 2020.[49]

Managerial career
Barcelona
B team
Guardiola coaching Barcelona B in 2008
Guardiola was appointed manager of Barcelona B on 21 June 2007 with Tito Vilanova as his assistant. Under his guidance, the team subsequently won their Tercera División group and qualified for the 2008 Segunda División B playoffs, which the team won, thereby achieving promotion.[50] Barcelona President Joan Laporta announced in May 2008 that Guardiola would be appointed manager of the senior Barcelona squad to replace Frank Rijkaard at the end of the 2007–08 season.[51]

2008–09: First season with first team and historic treble
Guardiola managing Barcelona in 2009
Upon being appointed, Guardiola made headlines by announcing that stars such as Ronaldinho, Deco and Samuel Eto'o were not part of his plans for the coming season,[52] though Eto'o was in the end allowed to remain.
In association with Barcelona Director of Sport Txiki Begiristain, several new signings were made by Guardiola – Dani Alves and Seydou Keita arrived from Sevilla; Martín Cáceres from Villarreal by way of Recreativo; Gerard Piqué returned from Manchester United; and Alexander Hleb was signed from Arsenal. Along with the new signings, Guardiola promoted canteranos Sergio Busquets, Pedro and Jeffrén to the first-team squad.[citation needed] In interviews with the press, Guardiola stressed a harder work ethic than before, but also a more personal approach during training and a closer relationship with his players.
Guardiola's first competitive game as manager was in the third qualifying round of the Champions League, in which Barcelona comfortably beat Polish club Wisła Kraków 4–0 in the first leg at home. They then lost 1–0 in the second leg, but progressed with a 4–1 aggregate victory. Promoted Numancia also defeated Barcelona in the opening matchday of the 2008–09 La Liga,[53] but the team then went on an undefeated streak for over 20 matches to move to the top of the league. Barcelona maintained their spot atop La Liga's table, securing their first league title since 2006 when rivals Real Madrid lost at Villarreal on 16 May 2009. The most important match, however, was on 2 May when they defeated Real Madrid 6–2 at the Santiago Bernabéu. The league title was the second piece of silverware in Guardiola's first season at the club. Earlier, on 13 May, Barcelona won the 2008–09 Copa del Rey, beating Athletic Bilbao 4–1 in the 2009 Copa del Rey final.[citation needed]
In the final of the Champions League, Barcelona beat Manchester United 2–0. In doing so, they became the first Spanish club to win the domestic cup, the league, and the European club titles (the treble) in the same season. Guardiola became the youngest man to manage a Champions League winning team, at age 37.[54]The treble-winning season is regarded as one of the club's finest in its history.[55]

2009–10: Six trophies in a calendar year
Guardiola in 2010
Guardiola's second season as manager began with defeats of Athletic Bilbao in the Supercopa de España and Shakhtar Donetsk in the UEFA Super Cup. On 25 September 2009, Barcelona gave him his 50th professional victory, away against Málaga and on 19 December, they were crowned FIFA Club World Cup champions for the first time in their history.[citation needed]
Guardiola finished the calendar year with a record six trophies, the Spanish League, Copa del Rey, Champions League, Spanish Super Cup, European Super Cup and Club World Cup, becoming the first manager in history to do so. In January 2010, he became Barcelona's longest serving Spanish manager, overtaking the record previously held by Josep Samitier. He agreed to a one-year contract extension to keep him with Barcelona until the end of the 2010–11 season.[56]
In February 2010, Guardiola managed his 100th match for Barcelona's first team. His record stood at 71 wins, 19 draws and ten losses, with 242 goals for and 76 against.[57] On 10 April 2010, he became the first manager in Barcelona's history to beat Real Madrid four times in a row in El Clásico. Barcelona reached the semi-finals of the 2009–10 Champions League, but lost 3–2 on aggregate to José Mourinho's Inter Milan.[58] Despite this, they managed to win their 20th La Liga title with 99 points by beating Real Valladolid 4–0 at home.[59] At the time, this was the highest points total ever gained amongst any of Europe's major leagues.[60] The La Liga title was Guardiola's seventh trophy as manager of the club, tying Ferdinand Daučík for second behind Johan Cruyff and his 11 trophies.[citation needed]

2010–11: Second Champions League title
On 21 August, Barcelona beat Sevilla 5–3 on aggregate to win the 2010 Supercopa de España, his second in a row. On 29 November 2010, Barcelona beat Real Madrid 5–0, giving Guardiola five straight wins in El Clásico. On 8 February 2011, Guardiola accepted the club's offer for a one-year deal extension, signing a contract until June 2012.[61]
On 11 May 2011, Barcelona won the La Liga title and the club's third in a row after a 1–1 draw with Levante.[62][63] On 28 May, Barcelona beat Manchester United 3–1 at Wembley in the 2011 Champions League final.[64]

2011–12: Final season
The season started with a 5–4 aggregate win over Real Madrid for the Supercopa de España.[65]
Barcelona won their second trophy of the season on 26 August, beating Porto 2–0 in the 2011 UEFA Super Cup.[66] With the trophy won against Porto, he became all-time record holder of most titles won as a manager at Barcelona, with 12 trophies in only three years.[67] November of the same year saw Guardiola manager his 200th match for Barcelona's first team. His record stood at 144 wins, 39 draws and 17 losses with 500 goals for and 143 against.[68]
Barcelona ended the 2011 calendar year winning the Club World Cup, beating Brazilian club Santos 4–0 in the final, the widest margin in an Intercontinental Cup/Club World Cup final since changing to a single match format. This was Guardiola's 13th title of only 16 tournaments played.[69] On 9 January 2012, he was named FIFA World Coach of the Year. On his 41st birthday, he led his side to a 2–1 victory over arch-rivals Real Madrid in El Clásico, ensuring that he remained unbeaten against Real Madrid in regular time as a manager. On 21 April, Guardiola conceded the league title to leaders Real Madrid after they beat Barcelona 2–1 and extended their lead in the table to seven points with four matches remaining. 
On 24 April, a 2–2 draw at home against Chelsea in the second leg of the Champions League semi-final knocked Barcelona out of the competition on a 2–3 aggregate score. That effectively left the team with only the Copa del Rey to play for.[70] Guardiola had faced criticism over his recent tactics and squad selections.[71] On 27 April 2012, he announced he would step down as Barcelona's manager at the end of the 2011–12 season. He had been on a rolling contract that was renewed annually during his tenure as manager. Citing tiredness as the main reason for his decision, he also commented that four years at a club like Barcelona felt like an eternity.[72]
Guardiola continued to lead Barcelona to wins in the remaining La Liga games of the season, followed by a 3–0 win in the Copa del Rey final. His record of 14 trophies in four seasons has made him the most successful manager in Barcelona's history. Barcelona announced that he would be succeeded by Tito Vilanova, who would begin leading the first team at the start of the 2012–13 season.[73]

Sabbatical
After his time at Barcelona came to an end, Guardiola took a year's sabbatical in New York City.[74] On 7 January 2013, he came in third place for the 2012 FIFA World Coach of the Year, behind the winner Vicente del Bosque and runner-up José Mourinho.[75] While at a news conference at the 2012 FIFA Ballon d'Or gala in Zürich, Guardiola said: "I have taken a decision to return to coaching but beyond that no decision has been taken. I don't have a team to go to but I would like to go back to coaching."[76]

Bayern Munich
2013–2015: Consecutive Bundesliga titles
Guardiola managing Bayern Munich in 2013
On 16 January 2013, it was announced that Guardiola would take over as manager of Bundesliga club Bayern Munich after the 2012–13 season, replacing Jupp Heynckes for the following season.[77][78] He addressed his first press conference at Bayern, on 24 June 2013, in German,[79] and had his first training session two days later.[80] His first official match was the German Super Cup against Borussia Dortmund, with Bayern losing 4–2.[81] His first trophy with Bayern was the 2013 UEFA Super Cup, defeating longtime adversary José Mourinho, who had just returned to manage at Chelsea. Bayern beat ten-man Chelsea in a shoot-out after Manuel Neuer saved Romelu Lukaku's kick.[82]
In December 2013, Guardiola won his third Club World Cup after beating Raja Casablanca in Morocco.[83] On 25 March 2014, he led Bayern to their 23rd Bundesliga title by beating Hertha Berlin 3–1 at the Olympiastadion in Berlin. With seven matches remaining in the season, it was the earliest the championship had been won in Bundesliga history, breaking the record Heynckes' Bayern had set in the previous season.[84] Guardiola broke Karl-Heinz Feldkamp's record for the longest winning streak to start his tenure at a Bundesliga club.[85] The streak ended at 28 when Augsberg defeated Bayern 1–0[86] on matchday 29.[87] The streak also ended Bayern's 53–match undefeated streak.[86]
Bayern were drawn against Real Madrid in the semi–finals of Champions League.[88] Bayern lost the first leg 1–0[89] and the second leg 4–0.[90] The first leg was also Guardiola's first defeat at the Santiago Bernabéu.[91] He finished the 2013–14 season by winning the DFB-Pokal 2–0 in extra–time.[92]

In the 2014-15 season, Bayern lost the German Super Cup 2–0 to Borussia Dortmund.[93] On 11 March 2015, Bayern defeated Shakhtar Donetsk 7–0, tying their largest win in Champions League history.[94] In Guardiola's 100th match as manager, Bayern defeated Porto 6–1.[95] With the win, Bayern reached their fourth-straight Champions League semi-final.[95] On 28 April 2015, Bayern were knocked out of the German Cup in a penalty shoot-out.[96] Bayern had missed all four of their shots.[96] In his first competitive match against Barcelona, Bayern lost 3–0.[97] Bayern failed to get a shot on target in the match.[98] For the first time in his career, he lost four in a row (including the shoot-out loss).[99]

2015–16: Second domestic double and final season
Guardiola during a press conference in 2015
The 2015–16 season started on 1 August 2015 when Bayern lost in a shoot-out to Wolfsburg in the German Super Cup.[100] In the league, Bayern won their first ten matches.[101] The first time they dropped points in the league was on 30 October 2015 in a 0–0 scoreline against Eintracht Frankfurt[101] and their first loss in the league was on 5 December 2015 in a 3–1 scoreline to Borussia Mönchengladbach.[102] In the Champions League group stage, Bayern won Group F,[103] winning five out of the six matches.[104] Bayern's only loss in the Champions League group stage was against Arsenal on 20 October.[105] This was Bayern's first loss in all competitions during the 2015–16 season.[106]
On 20 December, Bayern confirmed that Guardiola was leaving the club after his contract expired at the end of the season, with Carlo Ancelotti his replacement for the 2016–17 season.[107][108]
On 3 May 2016, Guardiola's Bayern Munich lost to Atlético Madrid in the Champions League semi-finals stage, thereby ending his final chance of winning a Champions League title with the Bavarian club.[109] Guardiola's final match was on 21 May 2016, with Bayern defeating Borussia Dortmund in a shootout.[110] He finished with a record of 82 wins, eleven draws and nine losses in the Bundesliga; a record of 14 wins, three draws and no losses in the DFB-Pokal; a record of 23 wins, five draws and eight losses in the UEFA Champions League.[111] He also went a combined two wins, two draws, and two losses in the FIFA Club World Cup, UEFA Super Cup, and the German Super Cup.[111] In non–official competitions, he went a combined six wins, one draw, and one loss.[111]

Manchester City
2016–17: Adjustment to England and first season
On 1 February 2016, Manchester City signed Guardiola to a three-year contract for the start of the 2016–17 season.[112] Guardiola brought in several significant players in the summer, including midfielders İlkay Gündoğan from Borussia Dortmund and Nolito from Celta Vigo, winger Leroy Sané from Schalke 04 and defender John Stones from Everton.[113] He also controversially replaced long-serving City starting goalkeeper Joe Hart with Claudio Bravo from his former club Barcelona; Hart would never make another appearance for the club.[114]
On 13 August 2016, Guardiola earned victory in his first match of the Premier League season, as City defeated Sunderland 2–1.[115] On 11 September, Guardiola won his first Manchester derby as a manager in a 2–1 City victory at Old Trafford; this was also his sixth win against his "rival" manager José Mourinho.[116]
City were leaders going into the international break, but their form declined thereafter. Manchester City lost to Everton 0–4 on 15 January 2017; this was Guardiola's biggest-ever managerial defeat in a domestic competition.[117] In Europe, City were eliminated in the Champions League round of 16 by Monaco on away goals after a 6–6 aggregate draw. The second leg of the tie was Guardiola's 100th game as a manager in European competition, and he arrived at that mark with the best record of any manager, having earned 61 wins and 23 draws (one draw better than the previous record holder, Guardiola's former manager at Barcelona, Louis van Gaal).[118] Following a loss to Arsenal in the FA Cup semi-finals, Guardiola finished the season without a trophy for the first time in his managerial career.

2017–18: "Centurions" and first Premier League title

Guardiola identified the defensive areas which required improvement for Manchester City in the summer transfer window to challenge for the league title, particularly in the goalkeeper and full-back positions. Due to Bravo's struggles the previous season, Ederson was brought in as the new first-choice goalkeeper. Wing-backs Benjamin Mendy and Kyle Walker were also signed, while dispensing of all the previous senior full-backs at the club in Aleksandar Kolarov, Gaël Clichy, Bacary Sagna and Pablo Zabaleta. Additionally, Bernardo Silva and Danilo were also acquired from Monaco and Real Madrid, respectively.[119]
On 25 February 2018, City won the 2017–18 EFL Cup after beating Arsenal 3–0 in the final, which was Guardiola's first trophy with the club.[120] On 15 April, City were confirmed as 2017–18 Premier League champions following Manchester United's 1–0 home defeat to West Bromwich Albion.[121] After finishing the league season with a record-breaking 100 points, Guardiola signed a new contract with City until 2021.[122][123]

2018–2020: Domestic treble and Champions League disappointment
During Guardiola's third season as manager, Manchester City signed Riyad Mahrez from Leicester City for a fee of £60 million.[124] On 5 August 2018, City kicked off the season with a 2–0 victory over FA Cup holders Chelsea in the 2018 FA Community Shield.[125]
On 24 February 2019, Guardiola's side played Chelsea in the EFL Cup final held at Wembley. The match ended 0–0 after extra time, and Manchester City won 4–3 on penalties to retain the trophy for the second year in a row.[126][127] On 9 April, City faced Tottenham Hotspur in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-finals, held at Tottenham's new stadium. The game ended in a 0–1 defeat for City.[128] The second leg was held at the Etihad Stadium on 17 April, where Guardiola's side beat Tottenham 4–3, with City's last-minute fifth goal having been controversially disallowed.[129] Due to the aggregate score being a 4–4 draw, Tottenham went through to the semi-finals on away goals.[130] On 12 May, Guardiola secured a second consecutive Premier League title. His side finished on 98 points, one point above Liverpool, after a 4–1 victory at Brighton & Hove Albion in the final match of the season.[131] On 18 May, City beat Watford 6–0 in the final of the FA Cup, becoming the first ever men's team in England to win a domestic treble.[132][133][134]
Guardiola made two major acquisitions during the summer transfer window of 2019 in defender João Cancelo from Juventus for £27.4m plus Danilo and midfielder Rodri from Atlético Madrid for a fee of £62.8 million, a club record.[135] These signings meant that the value of the City squad had exceeded €1 billion,[136] becoming the first football club in the world to assemble a squad with this value. On 4 August 2019, City began the season with a penalty shoot-out victory against Liverpool in the Community Shield, claiming the trophy for the second straight year. During the match, Guardiola also became the first Premier League manager to receive a yellow card from the referee.[137][138] On 1 March, Manchester City beat Aston Villa 2–1 in the 2020 EFL Cup final, winning the competition for a third successive season.[139] City finished second in the 2019–20 Premier League after a spring hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After defeating Real Madrid in the 2019–20 Champions League round of 16, Guardiola's side faced Lyon in the single-elimination quarter-finals on 15 August 2020. City lost the match 1–3 and was eliminated at the quarter-final stage for the third season in a row.[140]

2020–present: Premier League three-peat, Champions League win and continental treble
The 2020–21 season saw City's defence greatly improve compared to the last campaign, conceding just one goal in twelve matches played.[141] On 19 November 2020, Guardiola signed a new two-year contract with Manchester City until summer 2023.[142] He won his 500th game as manager after City beat Sheffield United 1–0 at home in the Premier League on 31 January 2020; it was the ninth game City had won in January, becoming the team with the most wins in a single month in the top four tiers of English football since the Football League began in 1888.[143] Following a 3–1 victory over Swansea City in the FA Cup on 10 February, Guardiola's side broke the record for the longest winning run in English top-flight football history, with fifteen straight victories for City in all competitions.[144]
Guardiola won his third Premier League title on 11 May after Manchester United's home defeat to Leicester City,[145] two weeks after beating Tottenham Hotspur 1–0 in the 2021 EFL Cup final to claim that trophy for the fourth successive time.[146] On 29 May, Manchester City played in the Champions League final for the first time in their history, losing to Chelsea 0–1. Following the match, Guardiola was criticised for his team selection and not starting a defensive midfielder. Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel also admitted that he was surprised not to see midfielder Fernandinho in the City starting line-up.[147][148][149][150]

Guardiola as manager of Manchester City in 2021
During the summer transfer window of 2021, Manchester City broke the British transfer record by signing Aston Villa midfielder Jack Grealish for £100m.[151] On 25 September, he surpassed Les McDowall as the manager with the most wins in Manchester City history following their 1–0 away victory over Chelsea in the Premier League. On 22 May 2022, Manchester City won the Premier League with a 3–2 victory over Aston Villa. This was Guardiola's fourth title at the club, placing him second on the list of managers with the most Premier League titles.[152]
During the 2022–23 season, Manchester City won their third consecutive Premier League title, their fifth under Guardiola.[153] On 3 June, the club won their second FA Cup under Guardiola after a 2–1 victory over rivals Manchester United in the final to achieve another domestic double.[154] On 10 June, he led the club to their first Champions League title, and his personal third, after a 1–0 win against Inter Milan in the final, which completed their continental treble.[155]
On 16 August 2023, Guardiola won a record-equaling fourth UEFA Super Cup title, also becoming the first ever manager to win the trophy with three different clubs, as the Mancunian side defeated Sevilla 5–4 on penalties following a 1–1 draw.[156][157] On 22 December, Guardiola guided City to their first FIFA Club World Cup trophy, as they beat Fluminense 4–0 in the final, and became the first English club to win five titles in a calendar year. With the win, Guardiola became the first manager in history to win four FIFA Club World Cup titles. Following the win, Guardiola stated that he "had the feeling [...] would close the chapter, we won all the titles, there’s nothing else to win. I had a feeling the job was done, it was over".[158][159]

Manager profile
Tactics
Although much emphasis is placed on retaining possession of the ball and dictating play, with the intent to have the opposing side's defence chase the ball for extended periods of play, Guardiola's teams are recognised for pressing off the ball. Players press and harry the opposition collectively in an attempt to win back possession of the ball. This collective press is only conducted in the starting third of the opposition's pitch where less space exists and defenders and/or the goalkeeper may not be as good at dribbling or passing the ball as a midfielder.
As high pressing became prominent, Guardiola sought to counteract it with goalkeepers and defenders comfortable with both long and short ball distribution. At Manchester City, Ederson routinely played accurate long balls up-field when City were pressed high, at times taking the entire opposition out-of-play and creating 1-on-1 situations for City forwards.[160][161] To avoid getting caught by long-range passing from City's defensive-third, the opposition defence would cautiously drop deep despite the forward line's high-press, hence creating space in the middle of the pitch.[162][163]
Guardiola has stated he tries to constantly evolve his tactics.[164] After learning the style analogous with Total Football under the Johan Cruyff,[165][166] Guardiola was particularly influenced by his time as a player in Mexico under his friend and manager at Dorados, Juan Manuel Lillo.[167] Guardiola also sought help of Marcelo Bielsa to learn from him.[165] His editorials for El Pais during the 2006 World Cup in praise of Luis Aragonés' Spanish side and Ricardo La Volpe's Mexican side reveal the extent of his reverence for possession-based, attacking football, with defenders along with the goal-keeper playing it out from the back,[168] which Guardiola later cited as a major inspiration on multiple occasions.[169] In one of his editorials, he called Zinedine Zidane France's best defender, pointing out how recycling possession in itself is a key defensive tactic,[168] something that Guardiola teams would later become synonymous with.[168][170] Philipp Lahm, who played for Guardiola at Bayern Munich, pointed out that Guardiola's tactics were majorly "an offensive Sacchi", modelled after the Arrigo Sacchi's Milan team of the late 1980s, emphasising fluid movement, quick recoveries, and keeping possession of the ball, which was in sharp contrast to the strictly-defensive  Catenaccio style employed effectively by José Mourinho and later by Diego Simeone; and that Guardiola has evolved his approach that seemingly was now a mix of both those styles.[171]
Tactics employed by Guardiola have been likened to Gegenpressing[172] invented by Ralf Rangnick[173] and used to great effect by Jürgen Klopp.[172][174] His tactics have influenced approaches of managers such as Maurizio Sarri,[175] Thomas Tuchel,[176][174] Graham Potter,[177] and Luis Enrique;[178] as well as those of other sports such as rugby.[179][180] Guardiola admitted that he had to adapt his style to German and English leagues, but his "football education comes from [Catalunya]" which is possession-based, and distinct from Gegenpressing.[181]

Reception
Considered by pundits to be one of the greatest managers of all time,[182][183] Guardiola is often linked with the successes of the Spanish and German national teams in 2010s, both of whom had many first-team players that were coached by him.[184]
Jürgen Klopp credits Guardiola with building the toughest teams he has ever faced, stating: "I could say City are the toughest opponent I've ever had but it wasn't much easier when I faced Pep's Bayern [..] We push each other to insane levels."[185]

Personal life
Guardiola was born to Dolors and Valentí. He has two older sisters and a younger brother, Pere Guardiola, a football agent.[186] He is an atheist.[187] Guardiola met his wife Cristina Serra when he was 18.[187] They married on 29 May 2014.[188] They have three children named Maria, Màrius and Valentina.[187]
Following his tenure as Barcelona's manager, he stated that he would move to the United States to live in Manhattan, New York, for a year, until he had decided on his future.[189] To prepare for his position as the manager of Bayern Munich, Guardiola studied German for four to five hours each day.[190]
Guardiola supports the political independence of Catalonia.[191] In 2015, he confirmed that he would participate in the pro-independence coalition, Junts pel Sí, in that year's regional parliamentary election.[192]
On 24 May 2023, Guardiola made a cameo appearance in Ted Lasso, in which Ted Lasso's (played by Jason Sudeikis) team, AFC Richmond, play against Manchester City and win. Guardiola gives Lasso a handshake following City's defeat and gives Lasso a word of advice, to which Lasso responds positively. Guardiola reportedly is a fan of the show and enjoys watching it with his wife and daughter.[193]
Guardiola was one of the 13 sports personalities named in the Pandora Papers published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).[194] He had an account open in the principality of Andorra until 2012, exploiting the tax amnesty that Mariano Rajoy's conservative government had enacted in Spain to regularise his fiscal situation. Until that point, he had not declared the funds held in that account to the Spanish Tax Agency.[195]

*Club domestic league appearances and goals
Carlo Ancelotti Cavaliere OMRI Ufficiale OSI (born 10 June 1959) is an Italian professional football manager and former player who is the manager of  Real Madrid. Nicknamed "Don Carlo",[4] he is regarded as one of the greatest managers of all time.[5][6][7] Ancelotti is the most decorated manager in UEFA Champions League history, having won the trophy a record four times as coach (twice with AC Milan and twice with Real Madrid). He is also the first and only one to have managed teams in five Champions League finals.[8] As a player, he won the European Cup twice with AC Milan in 1989 and 1990, making him one of seven people to have won the European Cup or Champions League as both a player and a manager. Ancelotti is also the first and only manager ever to have won league titles in all of Europe's top five leagues.[9] He has won the FIFA Club World Cup three times, and is also the manager with the joint-most UEFA Super Cup triumphs, having won the trophy on four occasions, managing Milan and Real Madrid.[10][11]
Ancelotti played as a midfielder and began his career with Italian club Parma, helping the club to Serie B promotion in 1979. He moved to Roma the following season, where he won a Serie A title and four Coppa Italia titles, and also played for the late 1980s Milan team, with which he won two league titles and two European Cups, among other titles. At international level he played for the Italy national team on 26 occasions, scoring once, and appeared in two FIFA World Cups, finishing in third place in the 1990 edition of the tournament, as well as UEFA Euro 1988, where he helped his nation to reach the semi-finals.
As a manager, Ancelotti worked for Reggiana, Parma and Juventus between 1995 and 2001, before rising to prominence with Milan. Appointed as manager in 2001, he went onto win both the 2002–03 Champions League and 2002–03 Coppa Italia. The following season, he won the Scudetto with an Italian record of 82 points from 34 games, and three years later he won his second Champions League with Milan. During his tenure with Milan, Ancelotti was awarded the Serie A Coach of the Year twice. He announced his resignation from Milan after the 2008–09 season, leaving as Milan's longest-serving manager in a single spell.[12]
In 2009, he was appointed manager of Chelsea, winning the domestic double of the Premier League and FA Cup in his first season. In 2011, he became the manager of French club Paris Saint-Germain; the following season he won them their first Ligue 1 title in 19 years and was awarded joint Ligue 1 Manager of the Year. Following his success in France, Ancelotti was appointed manager of Real Madrid. In his first season, he led Real Madrid to their long-sought tenth Champions League title, La Décima, and also won the Copa del Rey. Despite collecting further honours with the club and being awarded the Miguel Muñoz Trophy in 2014–15 for the best performing manager in La Liga, Ancelotti was dismissed from Real Madrid in May 2015. He became the manager of Bayern Munich in 2016, where he won the Bundesliga title in his first season, and following stints at Napoli and Everton between 2018 and 2021, he returned to Real Madrid in the summer of 2021, where he went on to win a La Liga–Champions League double.


Club career[edit]
Parma[edit]
Ancelotti began his career in 1974 with Parma. He made his professional debut in Serie C during the 1976–77 season, at the age of 18. Under manager Cesare Maldini, he was often deployed behind the forwards, or as a second striker, due to his eye for goal. Ancelotti excelled in these roles and helped Parma to a second place in the Serie C1 girone A during the 1978–79 season, which qualified the team for the Serie B play-offs. In the decisive match in Vicenza, against Triestina, with the score tied at 1–1, he scored two goals, which gave Parma a 3–1 victory and sealed their place in Serie B the following season.[13][14][15][16]

Roma[edit]

After attracting strong interest from Inter Milan, in mid-1979 Ancelotti transferred to Roma, and made his Serie A debut in a 0–0 draw against AC Milan on 16 September.[13][14][17] Under manager Nils Liedholm, he was deployed as a winger or central midfielder and became one of the club's most important players, in a team which featured Brazilian midfielders Falcão and Toninho Cerezo, as well as Italian footballers Roberto Pruzzo, Bruno Conti, Agostino Di Bartolomei and Pietro Vierchowod, winning consecutive Coppa Italia titles in his first two seasons with the club. During his eight seasons in Rome, he won the Coppa Italia a total of four times (1980, 1981, 1984 and 1986). After struggling with knee injuries, and managing second and third-place league finishes in 1981 and 1982, Ancelotti helped lead the team to win the Italian championship in 1983, the club's second league title in their history.[14] The following season, he even helped Roma to win another Coppa Italia title and reach the European Cup final in 1984, although he missed the final through injury, as Roma were defeated by Liverpool on penalties at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome.[13][14][17] He was named the team's captain in 1985 under new club manager Sven-Göran Eriksson, and served as a mentor to the young midfielder Giuseppe Giannini, as Roma won the Coppa Italia, but once again narrowly missed out on the league title during the 1985–86 Serie A season, finishing in second place behind Juventus.[13][14][16]

AC Milan[edit]
From 1987 until 1992, Ancelotti played for Milan, and was a key part of the squad that won the Serie A title in 1988, consecutive European Cups in 1989 and 1990, two European Super Cups, two Intercontinental Cups and a Supercoppa Italiana under manager Arrigo Sacchi.[13] During this time, Milan, under the financial backing of club president Silvio Berlusconi, featured players such as Paolo Maldini, Franco Baresi, Mauro Tassotti and Alessandro Costacurta as defenders; Frank Rijkaard, Ruud Gullit and Roberto Donadoni as midfielders; and Marco van Basten upfront.[14] One of Ancelotti's most memorable moments with Milan was when he received a pass from Ruud Gullit, dribbled around two Real Madrid players and netted a powerful long-range shot during the Rossoneri's 5–0 thrashing of Real Madrid in the 1989 European Cup semi-finals.[18] He went on to play all 90 minutes in Milan's 4–0 win over Steaua București in the final.[19]
The following season, Ancelotti suffered an injury to his left knee in the quarter-finals of the European Cup against KV Mechelen, which forced him to miss the semi-finals, although he was able to return in time to help Milan defend their title against Benfica in the final, held in Vienna.[14] Following Sacchi's departure, he won a second Serie A title under his replacement Fabio Capello during the 1991–92 Serie A season, as Milan won the title undefeated, but persistent knee injuries and competition from youngster Demetrio Albertini limited his playing time, and eventually forced him into premature retirement at the end of the season, at the age of 33. He played the final match of his career with the club in a 4–0 home win over Hellas Verona on 17 May 1992, in which he came off the bench in the final 20 minutes of the game and scored two goals, and was given an ovation by the fans.[13][14][16]

International career[edit]
Under manager Enzo Bearzot, Ancelotti made his Italy national team debut and scored his first and only goal on 6 January 1981 in the 1980 World Champions' Gold Cup against the Netherlands, which ended in a 1–1 draw.[14][17] He was very likely to be capped for the 1982 World Cup campaign, but a dramatic knee injury forced him away for several months, as Italy went on to win the tournament without him.[14][17]
He was a part of Italy's World Cup squad in the 1986 World Cup, where he did not make a single appearance, however, as both he and Paolo Rossi struggled during the team's fitness tests, due to the altitude of the region, and were replaced in the starting line-up by Fernando De Napoli and Giuseppe Galderisi respectively.[20]
Under new Italy manager Azeglio Vicini, he was also a key member of the Italy squad that reached the semi-finals of UEFA Euro 1988, and was also set to represent his nation at the Summer Olympics in Seoul that summer. An injury to the meniscus of his right knee, however, prevented him from taking part in the tournament, where Italy ultimately managed a fourth-place finish.[14]
Ancelotti later went on to play in the 1990 World Cup on home soil under Vicini at the age of 31, although an injury in the second group match against Austria once again limited his appearances in the competition to just three, and kept him on the sidelines until the third-place final against England, in which he returned to help Italy to a 2–1 win.[14]
Ancelotti made a total of 26 performances for the Italy national side, and announced his retirement from international football in 1991, making his final Italy appearance under Arrigo Sacchi.[14][17][16]

Style of play[edit]
A world-class player, Ancelotti was a creative, cautious and efficient midfielder who was known for his leadership, skill, composure on the ball and organisational ability; he is regarded as one of the best Italian midfielders of his generation.[13][14][15] Although he lacked pace, as well as notable physical and athletic characteristics, he was a highly talented, yet hard-working, combative and tenacious team-player, who was competent defensively, but who above all possessed excellent technical ability, tactical intelligence, vision and passing range, as well as a powerful and accurate shot from outside the area; his wide range of skills enabled him to contribute to his team's offensive play with goals and assists.
A versatile midfielder, he was capable of being deployed in several positions: while he was usually deployed as a playmaker in the centre of the pitch during his time with Milan under Arrigo Sacchi, he often played on the wings during his time with Roma, and was also capable of playing as an attacking midfielder, or even in a box-to-box role; in his youth, he was often deployed in a more advanced role as a forward, usually as a second striker.[14][17][21] As with Milan he was often deployed in front of the back-line, as a central or defensive midfielder, a position which allowed him to set the tempo of his team's play after winning back possession; he is regarded as having been the mentor and predecessor of Demetrio Albertini and Andrea Pirlo in the deep-lying playmaking role at the club. Despite his ability, his career was affected by several injuries, which limited his playing time, and forced him into retirement in 1992 at the age of 33.[14][21][16][22][23][24]

Ancelotti undertook his coaching studies at Coverciano, where he penned a research article entitled "Il Futuro del Calcio: Più Dinamicità"[25] (English: "The Future of Football: More Dynamism"). After serving as an assistant manager with the Italy national team under his former Milan coach Arrigo Sacchi between 1992 and 1995, and reaching the 1994 World Cup final,[13][15][17] Ancelotti began his managerial career with Serie B side Reggiana in 1995,[26] where he immediately aided the team in achieving promotion to Serie A;[17] he left after the 1995–96 Serie B season,[26] finishing with a record of 17 wins, fourteen draws and ten losses in his only season with the club.[27]

Parma[edit]
Ancelotti at Parma in 1996
Ancelotti joined Parma the following season,[28] a team which had recently enjoyed several years of domestic and European success under the previous manager Nevio Scala, and which contained several promising young players, including future Italy stars Gianluigi Buffon and Fabio Cannavaro.[29] Ancelotti made his debut in the Coppa Italia in a 3–1 loss to Pescara.[30] Ancelotti made several changes at the club, implementing a rigorous Sacchi-inspired 4–4–2 formation, and initially deploying creative forward Gianfranco Zola out of position on the left wing in order to accommodate Hristo Stoichkov up-front, although both players were later eventually sold by the club after lack of playing time, due to struggling to perform in this system.[31] With the new attacking partnership of Enrico Chiesa and Hernán Crespo, Parma finished second in Serie A during the 1996–97 season under Ancelotti, which guaranteed them a place in the next edition of the UEFA Champions League.[29][32] The following season, the club had agreed to sign another Italian creative forward, Roberto Baggio, but Ancelotti impeded the transfer as he once again did not feel that a player like Baggio would fit into his tactical plans.[29][31][33] Ancelotti later stated that he regretted this decision, stating that at the time he believed that the 4–4–2 was the ideal formation for success, and that offensive playmakers were not compatible with this system.[34] After suffering a first round elimination in the 1997–98 Champions League, and a semi–final appearance in the Coppa Italia,[35] Ancelotti was only able to guide Parma to a sixth-place finish in Serie A during the 1997–98 season, and was dismissed at the end of the season, despite qualifying the team for next season's UEFA Cup.[28][29][36]

Juventus[edit]
In February 1999, Ancelotti was appointed manager of Juventus, where he both succeeded and preceded Marcello Lippi, who returned to the club when Ancelotti left.[37][38] With Juventus, Ancelotti became less rigorous with the team's formation, abandoning his favoured 4–4–2 in order to accommodate French playmaker Zinedine Zidane in his preferred free role behind the forwards in the team's starting line-up.[31] His first full season at Juventus began promisingly, as he immediately won the Intertoto Cup with the club by beating Rennes 4–2 on aggregate,[39] although Juventus suffered a round of 16 elimination in the UEFA Cup, and lost the league title to Lazio by a single point on the final match-day of the season; this was after surrendering a five-point lead with three games remaining, which drew strong criticism from the fans and the board of directors.[17][36] The following season, Ancelotti went trophyless, finishing runner-up in Serie A yet again to Roma, and he was dismissed by Juventus.[17][19] Ancelotti's dismissal was announced by Juventus at half-time in the final league game of the season at home against Atalanta, on 17 June 2001, even though they were still within a chance of winning the title; Juventus won the match 2–1, although the result was not enough to prevent them from finishing behind Roma in the league.[36][40] Ancelotti finished his tenure with Juventus with a record of 63 wins, 33 draws and 18 losses.[41]

AC Milan[edit]
Ancelotti was appointed Milan manager on 5 November 2001, after Fatih Terim was dismissed due to poor results.[13][15][17][42] He was inheriting another recently trophyless team in Milan, as the Rossoneri had floundered domestically and in Europe since their last Scudetto victory in 1999. In the 2001–02 season, Ancelotti led Milan to qualify for the Champions League once again, as the team managed a fourth-place finish in Serie A,[43] and also reached semi-finals of the UEFA Cup, their best ever finish in the competition, losing out to Borussia Dortmund,[44][45] and also suffered a semi-final elimination in the Coppa Italia to Juventus.[44]
The following season, Ancelotti – who was heavily criticised by club owner Silvio Berlusconi due to his supposedly defensive tactics – was able to adopt a creative play in Milan while making several changes to the team's squad. He made Dida, still maligned for his 2000–01 Champions League howler against Leeds United, his new starting goalkeeper barely a month into the season, while converting budding attacking midfielder Andrea Pirlo to a defensive midfielder, playing him behind the number 10 (either Rui Costa or Rivaldo) in front of the team's back-line as a deep-lying playmaker in a 4–3–1–2 or 4–1–2–1–2 formation.[16][46][47][48] At the same time, Filippo Inzaghi and Andriy Shevchenko proved to be dominant and dynamic strikers, who were prolific in front of goal.[49]
Milan won the 2003 Champions League final,[50] beating Juventus 3–2 on penalties at Old Trafford,[51] and also won the 2003 Coppa Italia Final over Roma.[13] The following season, with the addition of Brazilian attacking midfielder Kaká, and Ancelotti's formidable four-man back-line of Cafu, Costacurta, Alessandro Nesta and Maldini, Milan took home the UEFA Super Cup in 2003 over Porto,[52] followed by the Scudetto in 2004 with an Italian record of 82 points from 34 games,[53] while Shevchenko finished the season as the league's top-scorer.[13][54][55] The Rossoneri, however, suffered penalty-shootout defeats to Juventus in the 2003 Supercoppa Italiana,[56] and to Boca Juniors in the 2003 Intercontinental Cup.[57] They were also knocked out by Deportivo de La Coruña in the 2003–04 UEFA Champions League.[58]
Under Ancelotti's reign, Milan also won the 2004 Supercoppa Italiana,[59] and were also back-to-back Serie A runners-up to Juventus in 2004–05[60] and 2005–06[61] (both Scudetti were later wiped from the record books of Juventus due to the club's involvement in the Calciopoli scandal). During the 2004–05 season, Ancelotti also led Milan to the 2005 Champions League final, where they lost out to Liverpool 2–3 on penalties after a 3–3 draw in normal time.[19][62] In the Coppa Italia, the team was unable to get past the quarter finals.[63] The following season, Milan once again faced disappointment as they lost out to Barcelona in the Champions League semi-finals,[64] and only reached the quarterfinals of the Coppa Italia.[65]

Ancelotti with AC Milan in 2007
After the departure of striker Andriy Shevchenko at the beginning of the 2006–07 season, Ancelotti was forced to redesign Milan's line-up once again, devising a 4–3–2–1 system that would later be known as his "Christmas Tree" formation. Milan's line-up used Inzaghi as a lone striker, supported by attacking midfielders Clarence Seedorf and Kaká, in front of a three-man midfield which featured Andrea Pirlo as a creative playmaker, supported by hard-working defensive midfielders Gennaro Gattuso and Massimo Ambrosini.[66] Milan received an eight-point deduction during the 2006–07 Serie A season for their role in the Calciopoli scandal,[67] which virtually put the team out of the title race, and instead led Ancelotti to focus on winning the Champions League.[68] On 23 May 2007, Milan avenged their defeat to Liverpool two years earlier with a 2–1 win at the Olympic Stadium in Athens in the 2007 Champions League final,[69] leading to Ancelotti's second Champions League trophy as Milan coach and his fourth title overall, having also won it twice as a Milan player in 1989 and 1990.[19] During the 2006–07 season, Milan also finished fourth in Serie A,[70] and lost out to eventual champions Roma in the Coppa Italia semi-final.[71] The next season, Ancelotti also won the 2007 UEFA Super Cup,[72] as well as the club's first ever FIFA Club World Cup in 2007, becoming the first manager to do so with a European side.[13] After finishing the league in fifth place,[73] Milan missed out on Champions League qualification,[74] and also suffered round of 16 eliminations in the Champions League[75] and Coppa Italia (to Arsenal and Catania respectively).[76]
In Ancelotti's final season at the club, Milan managed a third-place finish in Serie A behind Juventus and cross-city rivals Inter, sealing a place in the next season's Champions League,[77] while they were eliminated in the round of 32 of the UEFA Cup,[75] and the round of 16 of the Coppa Italia.[78] After previously denying rumours that he would be leaving the club, on 31 May 2009 Ancelotti announced his resignation from Milan – less than an hour after their 2–0 victory over Fiorentina in the final match of the season.[19][77] In total, Ancelotti led Milan for 423 games; only Nereo Rocco has been in charge of the club for more matches.[13]

Chelsea[edit]
On 1 June 2009, Ancelotti succeeded interim manager Guus Hiddink when he was confirmed as the new Chelsea manager after agreeing to a three-year contract, and formally assumed his duties on 1 July.[79] Ancelotti became the club's fourth permanent manager in 21 months, following José Mourinho, Avram Grant and Luiz Felipe Scolari. He was also the third Italian to manage Chelsea, after Gianluca Vialli and Claudio Ranieri.[citation needed]
On 9 August 2009, Ancelotti won his first trophy as Chelsea manager, the Community Shield, beating Manchester United on penalties, following a 2–2 draw. His first Premier League game in charge of the Blues ended in a 2–1 home victory over Hull City on 15 August.[80] Chelsea lost their first match under Ancelotti at the DW Stadium away to Wigan Athletic on 26 September, losing 1–3. They were eliminated from the League Cup on 2 December, reaching the quarter-finals stage, after a penalty shootout defeat to Blackburn Rovers after a 3–3 draw at Ewood Park.[81]

Ancelotti celebrates Chelsea's first League and Cup double with team captain John Terry in 2010
In the Champions League, Ancelotti returned to the San Siro for the first time since his departure from Milan, when his team faced Inter Milan, who was at the time coached by ex-Chelsea manager José Mourinho, at the Round of 16 stage. Ancelotti and Mourinho had a tense relationship from the previous season, as managers of Milan and Inter respectively.[82] Chelsea was eliminated from the Champions League on 16 March 2010 after a 1–3 aggregate loss to Inter, having lost 1–2 away and 0–1 at Stamford Bridge.[83][84]
On 9 May 2010, Ancelotti led Chelsea to the Premier League title, beating Manchester United by one point[85] and setting scoring records. The team finished the campaign with 103 goals, becoming the first team in the Premier League to score more than 100 goals in a season, and the first in the English top flight since Tottenham Hotspur in the 1962–63 season.[86] Chelsea secured the title with an 8–0 victory over Wigan at Stamford Bridge.[87] Ancelotti also became the first Italian manager to win the Premier League[88] and only the fifth manager overall in the League's 18 seasons. On 15 May 2010, Ancelotti led Chelsea to its first ever domestic double by defeating Portsmouth 1–0 in the FA Cup final at Wembley;[89] this was Chelsea's third FA Cup in four years, equalling the record set by Arsenal between 2002 and 2005.[citation needed]
The following season, after having lost to Manchester United in the 2010 FA Community Shield in August, Ancelotti led Chelsea to the top of the table on the first weekend of the season thanks to a 6–0 rout of newly promoted West Bromwich Albion. Chelsea followed up this result with another 6–0 win, this time over Wigan, while Stoke City were beaten 2–0 in the next match. Chelsea had a good start to the season, winning their first five matches. Chelsea then lost 3–4 against Newcastle United on 23 September 2010 in the League Cup.[90] They then went on to lose against Manchester City in the Premier League 0–1 after a cleverly-taken strike by City captain Carlos Tevez. Chelsea made a good start in Europe by beating MŠK Žilina and Marseille 4–1 and 2–0, respectively, in the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League. Chelsea then defeated fourth-placed Arsenal 2–0 on 3 October 2010, courtesy of a goal from Didier Drogba and a free-kick by defender Alex.[91]

Ancelotti with Chelsea in October 2010
Chelsea's next defeat of the season came against Liverpool at Anfield on 7 November 2010, where they lost 0–2 with both goals coming from Fernando Torres. A week later, Chelsea suffered their second Premier League defeat in three matches with a remarkable 0–3 home defeat to Sunderland. In their following five league games, they lost two and drew three games, culminating in a 1–3 loss to Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium. On 5 January 2011, Chelsea suffered a shock 0–1 defeat at struggling Wolverhampton Wanderers, leaving them fifth in the league and in real danger of missing out on a Champions League place for the first time since 2002.[92] This result led to Ancelotti ruling out Chelsea's chances of retaining the title, insisting that he did not fear that he would be dismissed.[93] After this match, however, Chelsea's form began to improve. First with a 7–0 thrashing of Ipswich Town in the FA Cup at Stamford Bridge, and then a 2–0 victory over Blackburn, followed by emphatic away wins against Bolton Wanderers and Sunderland, putting them in fourth position in the league, though still ten points behind leaders Manchester United.[citation needed]
On 31 January 2011, Chelsea signed Liverpool striker Fernando Torres for a then-British record fee of £50 million, and Benfica defender David Luiz for £22 million. Chelsea lost 0–1 to Liverpool at Stamford Bridge but beat league leaders Manchester United on 1 March in a 2–1 comeback win that saw David Luiz net his first goal for Chelsea, which was followed by a 3–1 win away to Blackpool. Chelsea were later defeated by Manchester United at home and away (aggregate of 1–3) in the Champions League quarter-finals.[94]
Following their defeat in the Champions League, Chelsea made a remarkable comeback in the league, defeating Wigan 1–0 at home, West Brom 3–1 away, Birmingham City 3–1, West Ham United 3–0 and Tottenham 2–1 at home. Chelsea, who at one point were fifth and 15 points behind leaders Manchester United, vaulted into the second position the league, just three points behind them with three games left of the season.[citation needed]
On 8 May, however, Chelsea lost 1–2 against Manchester United at Old Trafford to stay second in the league, now six points behind the leaders with just two more games to play.[95]
Ancelotti was dismissed less than two hours after a 0–1 away defeat against Everton on 22 May 2011, Chelsea's last Premier League match of the season.[96] They had finished the 2010–11 Premier League in second place.[97] He reportedly received a severance payment of £6 million from Chelsea.[98] Ancelotti finished with a record of 67 wins, 20 draws and 22 losses in 109 matches.[99] Ancelotti's win percentage at Chelsea was (as of May 2016) the third-highest in Premier League history, behind only José Mourinho and Alex Ferguson.[100]

Paris Saint-Germain[edit]
Ancelotti with Paris Saint-Germain in 2012
On 30 December 2011, with Paris Saint-Germain at the top of the Ligue 1 with three points down to Montpellier, Ancelotti was appointed as the new manager of the club on the same day as their previous manager, Antoine Kombouaré, was released from his contract.[101] On 21 March 2012, Ancelotti experienced his first defeat in charge of PSG as the club fell to a 1–3 defeat at the hands of Lyon in a Coupe de France quarter-final match.[102] Ten days later, PSG suffered their first Ligue 1 defeat under Ancelotti when they lost 1–2 away to Nancy.[103] PSG ended up as runners-up in Ligue 1 in Ancelotti's first season in charge, three points behind winners Montpellier.[104] He also took PSG to the Coupe de France quarter-finals.[105] The club were eliminated from the Coupe de la Ligue and UEFA Europa League prior to Ancelotti's appointment.[105]
During Ancelotti's first full season at the club, PSG entered the winter break at the top of the Ligue 1 table, ahead of Lyon and Marseille on goal difference. They clinched the Ligue 1 title on 12 May 2013, with two matches to spare.[106][107][108] The club reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League, where they lost to Barcelona on the away goals rule (3–3 on aggregate), the quarter-finals of the Coupe de France and the quarter-finals of the Coupe de la Ligue.[109] On 19 May 2013, Ancelotti asked to leave the club, in order to join Real Madrid.[110]

Real Madrid[edit]
On 25 June 2013, Ancelotti became the manager of Real Madrid, replacing the departing José Mourinho, and signing a three-year contract.[111][112] He was introduced at a press conference at the Santiago Bernabéu, where it was also announced that Zinedine Zidane and Paul Clement would be his assistant coaches. Shortly following his arrival, Real Madrid confirmed the signing of Isco for a fee of €24 million, which was followed by the signing of Asier Illarramendi for €32 million. Argentinean striker Gonzalo Higuaín left the club for €40 million to Napoli. This, along with the sale of Mesut Özil to Arsenal, paved the way for Gareth Bale's signing from Tottenham Hotspur for then-world record fee of £86 million (€105M).[113] In Ancelotti's first league game in charge, on 18 August 2013, Real Madrid started the season by winning 2–1 at home against Real Betis.[114] Ancelotti eventually deviated from the 4–2–3–1 formation that had been deployed by his predecessor José Mourinho, switching instead to a 4–3–3 formation to great effect, in which Argentine winger Ángel Di María particularly excelled as a left-sided central midfielder, and played a key role in the club's successes.[115]
On 16 April 2014, Ancelotti won his first major trophy as Real Madrid manager after they defeated Barcelona 2–1 in the Copa del Rey final held at the Mestalla Stadium.[116] On 29 April, Real Madrid defeated Bayern Munich in the semi-finals of the Champions League by an aggregate score of 5–0 (1–0 in Madrid and 0–4 in Munich), with Los Blancos reaching their first final since they last won the competition in 2002.[117] Madrid finished third in the La Liga, accumulating 87 points in total (level with Barcelona, losing out on the second place on a tie-breaker, and three behind champions Atlético Madrid).[118] On 24 May, Real Madrid won their tenth Champions League trophy, after defeating recently crowned rivals Atlético Madrid in the final 4–1 after extra time.[119] Ancelotti became only the second manager after Liverpool's Bob Paisley to win the competition on three occasions, and the first man to win the Champions League/European Cup twice as a player and three times as a manager to this day.[120]
On 12 August, Ancelotti started the new season by winning another European trophy, leading Real Madrid to a 2–0 victory over Sevilla in the 2014 UEFA Super Cup. In the last four months of 2014, his team set a Spanish record of 22 consecutive victories in all competitions that began on 16 September and culminated with Real Madrid's first FIFA Club World Cup title in December 2014, finishing the year with four trophies.[121] On 1 December 2014, Ancelotti was nominated as one of the three finalists for the 2014 FIFA World Coach of the Year Award.[122] On 19 January 2015, Ancelotti was inducted into the Italian Football Hall of Fame[123] and on 20 January 2015, he won the IFFHS 2014 Award as The World's Best Club Coach.[124] Real Madrid finished the 2014–15 season in second place with 92 points, two off treble-winning Barcelona, and scoring a record 118 goals in the process.[125] They were eliminated in the round of 16 of the Copa del Rey by Atlético Madrid, whom they faced eight times throughout the season (including the UCL quarter-finals),[126] and lost 3–2 on aggregate to Juventus in the Champions League semi-finals.[127] On 25 May 2015, Real Madrid president Florentino Pérez announced that the club's board had taken "a very difficult decision" to relieve Ancelotti of his duties with immediate effect. Pérez stated that Ancelotti had won the hearts of both the board and fans, and would always have a place in the club's history because he was the coach that led them to the Décima. "However at this club the demands are huge and we need a new impulse in order to win trophies and be at our best," he added.[128][129][130]
After leaving Madrid, Ancelotti held talks about a return to Milan, which he rejected, saying: "It was hard to say no to such a beloved club to me, but I need some rest. I wish them the best". He stated that he wanted to take a year off and undergo an operation for his spinal stenosis.[131] He later relocated to Vancouver.[132]

Bayern Munich[edit]
Ancelotti with Bayern Munich in 2017
On 20 December 2015, Bayern Munich CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge confirmed that Ancelotti would replace Pep Guardiola as manager for the 2016–17 season, signing a three-year contract.[133] His contract started on 1 July 2016.[134] His first training session was on 11 July 2016,[135] and his first match was a pre–season win against SV Lippstadt.[136] His first match at Allianz Arena was a 1–0 pre–season win over his predecessor Guardiola's Manchester City.[137] Bayern participated in the International Champions Cup.[138] In the first match, Bayern lost to Milan in a shootout.[139] In the second match, Bayern defeated Inter Milan.[140] In the final match, Bayern lost to Real Madrid.[141]
On 14 August 2016, Bayern defeated Borussia Dortmund 2–0 in the 2016 DFL-Supercup.[142] This was his first trophy as Bayern's manager.[143] On 26 August 2016, in his Bundesliga debut, Bayern defeated Werder Bremen 6–0.[144] In addition to defeating Borussia Dortmund,[143] Carl Zeiss Jena[145] and Werder Bremen,[144] they defeated Schalke 04,[146] Rostov,[146] Ingolstadt 04,[146] Hertha BSC[146] and Hamburger SV[146] to win his first eight matches as head coach, before losing to Atlético Madrid.[147] They continued their winless streak against FC Köln and Eintracht Frankfurt, before beating PSV.[146] After the win against Eindhoven, Bayern went on a three match winless streak.[146] Bayern drew against 1899 Hoffenheim and lost against Borussia Dortmund and Rostov, before defeating Bayer Leverkusen.[146] On 29 April, Ancelotti led Bayern to their fifth consecutive Bundesliga title and their 27th overall, following a 6–0 away win over VfL Wolfsburg.[148] However, Bayern were eliminated in the Champions League in a quarter-final clash against Ancelotti's former team Real Madrid.[149] They also lost 3–2 to Borussia Dortmund in the DFB-Pokal semi-finals.[150]
On 5 August 2017, Ancelotti started the 2017–18 season with Bayern Munich by retaining the DFL-Supercup, beating out Borussia Dortmund 5–4 on penalties, following a 2–2 draw after 90 minutes; this was the sixth time that Bayern had managed to win the title.[151] However, on 28 September 2017, Ancelotti was dismissed as manager of Bayern Munich, following a 3–0 away loss to Paris Saint-Germain in the club's second group match of the 2017–18 Champions League the night before.[152] After the Paris Saint-Germain match, reports surfaced that Ancelotti had lost the dressing room. It was reported that five senior players wanted Ancelotti out as manager, which Bayern's president Uli Hoeneß later confirmed. Questions were also raised about Ancelotti's tactical setup and team selection against Paris Saint-Germain, when he left several key players on the bench, and one was left to watch the match from the stands.[153]

Napoli[edit]
On 23 May 2018, Ancelotti was appointed as head coach of Napoli, signing a three-year contract, replacing Maurizio Sarri in the role.[154][155] On 19 August, he made his return to the Serie A, winning his first match as manager with a 2–1 away victory over Lazio.[156] On 10 December 2019, Ancelotti was dismissed, despite a 4–0 home win against Genk in their final 2019–20 UEFA Champions League match of the group stage that ensured Napoli's advancement to the round of 16.[157] The decision came after a summit with Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis that had followed the match that was originally scheduled for 11 December.[158]

Everton[edit]
On 21 December 2019, Ancelotti was appointed as manager of Everton on a four-and-a-half-year contract.[159] His first match in charge was a 1–0 home victory over Burnley on 26 December.[160] On 1 March 2020, Ancelotti was sent off after the full-time whistle, following an on-pitch conversation with the referee Chris Kavanagh, who had ruled out a would-be late match-winning goal against Manchester United, due to an offside that was determined by VAR.[161] He was charged with misconduct by the FA the following day.[162] Ancelotti went on to record a total of eight wins, five draws and six losses in the league in his first season with the Blues, as Everton finished in twelfth place.[163]
During the close-season, Ancelotti signed his former players James Rodríguez and Allan, along with Ben Godfrey, Abdoulaye Doucouré, Niels Nkounkou and loanee Robin Olsen.[164] Everton started the 2020–21 season with seven consecutive wins in all competitions,[165] and Ancelotti was named September's Premier League Manager of the Month.[166] After a drop in form, a resumption of good results saw Everton ending 2020 in fourth place, but knocked out of the EFL Cup, losing 2–0 to Manchester United in the quarter-final.[167] Results for the remainder of the season were mixed, and Everton finished the season in tenth place.[168]

Return to Real Madrid[edit]
On 1 June 2021, Ancelotti resigned from his position at Everton to rejoin Real Madrid, following Zidane's resignation, signing a contract until 2024.[169] On 19 September 2021, Ancelotti reached the milestone of 800 league matches with clubs from the top five European leagues.[170] On the domestic front, he delivered two trophies out of possible three, winning La Liga and the Supercopa de España.[171][172][173] As such, Ancelotti won all six available top trophies at Madrid,[174] in addition to becoming the first manager to win all of Europe's top five leagues.[175] In the Champions League final against Liverpool, a lone Vinícius goal sealed the 14th European Cup for Los Blancos, and Ancelotti's second in charge. Real also claimed their fourth ever European double.[176][177] With this win, Ancelotti became the first manager in history to win four Champions League titles.[178]
At the start of the 2022–23 season, Ancelotti guided his club to a UEFA Super Cup victory, his eighth trophy at Madrid.[179] On 2 November 2022, he won a record of 103 Champions League matches, after a 5–1 win over Celtic.[180] On 11 February 2023, Ancelotti guided them to a fifth FIFA Club World Cup trophy, as Real Madrid beat Al Hilal 5–3 in the final.[181] Real Madrid finished the season second to Barcelona in La Liga, and were also defeated by Manchester City in the Champions League semi-finals, but beat Osasuna 2–1 to win the 2022–23 Copa del Rey.
Managing to win all three opening matches of Madrid's 2023–24 league campaign, he was named La Liga's Coach of the Month in August.[182] With his team's 2–1 victory over Real Sociedad on 17 September 2023, Ancelotti got his 173rd Madrid win, overtaking Zinedine Zidane to become the coach with the second most wins in the club's history.[183]
On 29 December 2023, Real Madrid announced that Ancelotti had agreed to a contract extension until 30 June 2026.[184][185]

Style of management and reception[edit]
Ancelotti coaching his players from the technical area in 2012
Toward the beginning of his coaching career, and during his time with Parma, Ancelotti preferred to use a rigorous 4–4–2 formation, which made use of heavy pressing, and drew influence from that of his Milan and Italy coach Arrigo Sacchi, and which he believed to be the most successful system for his team; however, this system did not allow for more creative forwards, such as Gianfranco Zola, Hristo Stoichkov and Roberto Baggio, to play in their preferred positions, and ultimately led to Zola and Stoichkov's departure from the club, while Baggio's transfer to Parma in 1997 was impeded by Ancelotti. Ancelotti later stated that he regretted his intransigence, and when he joined Juventus, he abandoned his favoured 4–4–2 in favour of a 3–4–1–2 system, in order to accommodate Zinedine Zidane in his preferred advanced playmaking role behind the forwards.[16][186][29][34][31][33][187] In addition to Sacchi, Ancelotti has also cited his former Roma manager Nils Liedholm, and his youth coach Bruno Mora as major influences.[188][189][190]
Despite his initial reputation as a tactically inflexible coach, with Milan Ancelotti later drew praise for his ability to find systems which would best suit his players, and which allowed several talented and creative players to co-exist; under Ancelotti's management, the club enjoyed one of the most fruitful spells in its history. Carlo Ancelotti's Milan sides almost always used a strong four-man back-line, a main striker and an attacking midfielder. In his first seasons with the club, although he was initially criticised by the club's president Berlusconi, due to his supposedly defensive tactics, Ancelotti was able to implement a more creative playing style based on possession when he notably adopted a 4–3–1–2, 4–1–2–1–2 or 4–4–2 diamond formation. While still preserving the team's strong defensive line, Ancelotti converted attacking midfielder Andrea Pirlo to a deep-lying playmaker, which saw him play in a seemingly defensive midfield role in front of the back-line, and behind the team's advanced playmaker, either Rui Costa or Rivaldo, giving the Italian more time on the ball to orchestrate the team's attacking moves from deeper areas, or to create goalscoring opportunities for the team's prolific strikers with his accurate long passing ability; the team's two playmakers were supported defensively by box-to-box midfielders on either side of them in the midfield diamond. Due to competition from Alessandro Nesta, Paolo Maldini, Roque Júnior, Dario Šimić, and later Jaap Stam in defence, he also converted former centre-back Alessandro Costacurta to a defensive left-back, alternating him with Kakha Kaladze or Giuseppe Pancaro, while, due to the club's narrow midfield, the club's attacking right-back, Cafu, was given licence to attack and provide width to the team; due to Cafu's offensive capabilities, Ancelotti occasionally fielded a 4–4–1–1 or 3–4–1–2 formation, which saw Cafu used as an outright winger, along with Serginho or Marek Jankulovski on the left.[16][46][47][48][49][187][188][191][192][193][194][195][196][197][excessive citations]
After the departure of one of the club's main strikers at the beginning of the 2006–07 season, Andriy Shevchenko, Ancelotti redesigned Milan's line-up, devising a 4–3–2–1 system, later known as his "Christmas Tree" formation. Milan's line-up used either Filippo Inzaghi or Alberto Gilardino as a lone striker, supported by two attacking midfielders, Clarence Seedorf and Kaká, in front of a three-man midfield which once again featured Andrea Pirlo as a deep-lying playmaker, supported by two hard-working defensive midfielders, such as Gennaro Gattuso, Massimo Ambrosini, or Cristian Brocchi.[16][66]
Moving to Chelsea, in the 2009–10 season Ancelotti continued with the 4–4–2 diamond formation used previously at Milan, often with Michael Essien or Mikel John Obi in the defensive role, Michael Ballack or Frank Lampard as box to box midfielders and Deco in a creative role, with full-backs Ashley Cole and José Bosingwa pushing forward and providing width to the narrow midfield. Later in the season the Africa Cup of Nations left Chelsea without strikers Salomon Kalou or Didier Drogba (as well as midfielders Essien and Mikel) and harder to play with a 4–4–2, so Ancelotti switched to the 4–3–2–1 "Christmas Tree" formation he had also used at Milan, using Joe Cole and Florent Malouda to support lone striker Nicolas Anelka. He also used the 4–2–3–1 and 4–3–3 to be less predictable and better use creative players like Lampard and Malouda.[198][199][200]
At Real Madrid, Ancelotti similarly drew praise for his versatility; he modified the team's 4–2–3–1 formation, which had been used under José Mourinho, to a 4–4–2 formation, before settling on a 4–3–3 formation, in which Argentine former winger Ángel Di María was converted to a left-sided central midfielder, while Cristiano Ronaldo was played in his preferred free role on the left wing rather than as a striker, as Ancelotti had initially intended. Di María particularly excelled in this new role and played a key role in the club's successes.[115][201][202][203] Ancelotti later explained that his use of Cristiano Ronaldo in a free role on the left flank was due to the fact that the winger's style of play was less suited to a playing with his back to goal as a centre-forward; the wider role instead allowed him space to roam freely around the attack.[204] Striker Karim Benzema was instead tasked with acting as a false 9 in the centre, while Bale played as an inverted winger on the opposite flank to Ronaldo.[203]
In addition to his tactical prowess and adaptability, Ancelotti has also drawn praise for his kindness, good humour, and his calm, balanced approach as a manager, as well as his ability to motivate his players and cultivate a good relationship with them, and foster a united, winning team environment, although he has also been known to lose his temper at times.[16][188][201][202][205][206][207] During Ancelotti's first season with Bayern Munich, Spanish midfielder Thiago praised Ancelotti for the freedom he gave the players to express themselves and for the confidence with which he instilled them; Ancelotti commented on the tactical changes he implemented at Bayern Munich, stating "[t]he main change is we press a bit more intermittently and we try to play more directly, more vertically," also adding that "if you're organised even an ordinary player can do very well because he'll have options and he'll know where they are and how to find them. But when you get to the final third, everything changes. That's where you need creativity and freedom because without it you only have sterile possession. Especially if your opponent's defence is organised and has been paying attention."[187][208]
During his second spell at Real Madrid, although he implemented a more simple but effective counter–attacking style with the team, Ancelotti once again earned praise in the media for his balanced approach, adaptability, and man–management abilities during the club's run to a Liga–Champions League double; his ability to develop a strong relationship with his players and his willingness to consult them on tactical decisions were singled out by several pundits in particular as reasons for the team's success and unity. Regarding this aspect of his coaching philosophy, he commented in 2022: "I think that the methodology of training in football has changed a lot in the last 20 years. So I've had to be ready to change my style and my idea of football, because the rules have changed. It's a completely different sport. But what hasn't changed is my relationship with the players. That's the same." In contrast to his first spell in the Spanish capital, Benzema was now given a free attacking role, becoming the focal point of the team's offensive line; this new role enabled the striker to be extremely prolific, which was a key component to the team's success.[203][209][210][211]
Nicknamed Don Carlo by the Spanish media,[4] Ancelotti is regarded as one of the greatest and most successful managers of all time, and has drawn praise in the press for his longevity as well as his record–breaking achievements.[5][6][7][210]

Personal life[edit]
Ancelotti has two children: a daughter, Katia; and a son, Davide, who was his assistant coach at Everton, and now also at Real Madrid. Davide previously also played in the Milan youth team and joined Borgomanero in June 2008.[212] In 2008, Ancelotti confirmed in an interview that he had broken up with his wife of 25 years, Luisa Gibellini.[212][213] He subsequently dated Romanian Marina Crețu. In 2011, it was announced he was dating Canadian businesswoman Mariann Barrena McClay.[214] Ancelotti and Barrena McClay married in Vancouver in July 2014.[215]
In May 2009, Ancelotti's autobiography, Preferisco la Coppa ("I Prefer the Cup", with a word-play by Ancelotti on the Italian word "coppa" that stands both for "cup" and a type of cured cold pork meat cut, which is produced in Ancelotti's native region of Emilia-Romagna), was published, with all proceeds from sales of the book going to the Fondazione Stefano Borgonovo for the funding of research on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[216]
In his last season with Chelsea, Ancelotti had to travel back to Italy on a regular basis to visit his 87-year-old father who was in poor health with diabetes and other issues. On the issue, he said: "I don't have a problem managing the team for this reason. It's difficult, emotionally, when it's your father... but this is life. I have to do my best to stay close to him, but this is the life."[217] His father died on 29 September 2010, aged 87.[218]
On 31 January 2019, Ancelotti became the grandfather of twins, born to his son Davide's wife Ana Galocha.[219] He is a Roman Catholic.[220] In February 2021, Ancelotti's home in Crosby was burgled and a safe stolen by two male offenders wearing black clothing and balaclavas.[221] The safe was later found dumped in a car park in nearby Thornton. It had been forced open and stripped of its contents.[222]
Ancelotti is among the 13 sports personalities mentioned in the Pandora Papers published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).[223]
On 11 October 2023, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Parma, following his research in "Sciences and Techniques of Preventive and Adapted Motor Activities".[224]
